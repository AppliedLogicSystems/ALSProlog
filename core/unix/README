Welcome to the Unix Core
========================

The directories core/unix and core/alsp_src/unix contain most of the Unix
specific core files.

Build Instructions
------------------

Run GNU Make in core/unix.

Using Alternative Compilers
---------------------------

Use core/alsp_src/unix/gcc_makefile as a guide to building alternative
modular compiler makefile fragments.

The makefile variable CCOMP is used to control which compiler is used in a
build. Its default value is gcc which causes gcc_makefile to be included
in the Makefile. 

CCOMP can be set in core/unix/Makefile or in the sub-OS build directory
core/unix/$(SUBOS)/Makefile.
