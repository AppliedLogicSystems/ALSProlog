ProCS - Prolog-Based Client-Server Framework

A ProCS client-server implementation consists of Prolog-defined
servers and Prolog (or other language)-defined clients, all 
communicating via TCP/IP sockets. The ProCS package provides a 
conceptual framework together with frameworks and supporting library 
which make possible a rapid implementation of a ProCS-based system 
on any combinations of platforms supported by ALS Prolog.

A ProCS server runs in an infinite loop, listening on a 
collection of sockets, and serving the requests that it
receives on those sockets. The principal server loop predicate
carries around a Prolog term which encodes it's entire state.
Each particular implementation of a ProCS server will normally
utilize different versions of this data structure, according to
the particular application which they implement.  A particular
ProCS implementation is created by specifying this data structure,
the format of the initialization file, and supplying the prolog
predicates which define the application-specific services 
to be provided by the server.

The data structure is specified as a defStruct, with the minimal 
defStruct specification being as follows (file: sktsrvtp.typ):

module socket_comms.

defStruct(server_info, [
		propertiesList = [
				%% all applications should have the following:
			log_warnings/false,     %% {true,false (default)}
			log_info/false,         %% {true,false (default)}
			log_file/nil,			%% file name for logging
			log_stream/nil,         %% stream to log file (when logging)
			polling_timeout/10000,	%% timeout for polling streams
			ports_list/[]			%% list of basic port numbers
			],
		accessPred = access_server_info,
		setPred =    set_server_info,
		makePred =   make_server_info,
		structLabel = server_info
	] ).

endmod.
