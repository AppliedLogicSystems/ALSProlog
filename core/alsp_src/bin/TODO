- sharme and sharbld need to be fixed to reflect being moved from
  the toplevel of alsp_src to here in alsp_src/bin.

- outgz needs to be fixed to reflect being moved from
  the toplevel of alsp_src to here in alsp_src/bin;  also, it needs:
	- to take an argument to specify the output file;
    - an option arg for where to write intermediate temp files;
    - to apply gzip at the final step
    - option args to allow compress instead of gzip

- make an outgz.bat to do outgz on dos, ending up with pkzip
