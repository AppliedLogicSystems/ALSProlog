# This script will "fix" the output of the cvs rdiff command.  The cvs rdiff
# has the unfortunate characteristic of telling the user about files which
# have been removed and are no longer of interest anymore....even _really_
# old files.  Therefore much of the output from cvs rdiff is worthless. This
# script removes the worthless portions.
