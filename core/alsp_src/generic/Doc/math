If code for exception check changes, the corresponding code in ic_end_macro
must be changed also.

Macro code is put down in the following fashion. This is done by ic_put_macro.

	Overflow test (for interrupt)
	If no overflow event then goto inline
	structure building code

				; If macro goal is not last goal in clause.
	call to procedure
	goto nextGoal

				; If macro goal is last goal in clause.
	deallocate	; if any
	jump to procedure

inline:
	macro code


				; If macro goal is not last goal in clause.
nextGoal:
	Rest of clause code.

				; If macro goal is last goal in clause.
	deallocate	; if any
	proceed
