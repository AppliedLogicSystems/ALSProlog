	* Version 2.08 dev

	* Extension of ttymkshl to support generating socket-based
	  servers; now in shellmak.pro;

	* Major revision of consult; now supports:
	  - consult/2 with options list
	  - default behavior is "reconsult"
	  - searchlists
	  - correct interaction with -obp placement of obp files
	  - auto invocation of comptype on *.tty files, as appropriate
	  - auto invocation of mk_shell on *.spc files, as appropriate
	  - addition of blt_shlr.pro to support the interface between
		the consult machinery and tools such as comptype; intented
		to be the utlimate home of all shell-specific resources
		(e.g., error messages, etc.)
	  - consult machinery viewed as part of the development shell:
		blt_cslt.pro extracted from blt_io.pro, with very primitive
		consulting machinery left for primitive loading:

Fri 09 Feb 1996 Ken Bowen/Chuck Houpt
	* Various ifdefs & minor mods to support (running) Windows95 version;

	* Fixed bug in reading floating point #s when 'e' falls on end of buffer;

	* Fixed tests so the tests using files for input use test files; makes
	  everything uniform on all platforms;

	* Moved processing of raw level of command line out of main.c into
	  a builtin (pbi_command_line) which called in blt_shl.pro;

	* Suppressed the 'debug:nospy' in the beginning of start_shell (blt_shl.pro)

	* Tagged as V1-77

	* Added resetting of global HB register from the local shadow
	  at exit from run_wam (very end) in port/wam.c [wm_HB = mr_HB;]
	  to correct: setting up of HB during a freeze which wasn't shadowed
	  by a newer choice point was being lost.


	* Added missing UNSHADOW_REGS/SHADOW_REGS regs wrapper around
	  calls to combin_dels/2 in the VVBIND macros in port/wam.c

	* Split the VVBIND macro and the UNSHADOW_REGS/SHADOW_REGS
	  macros into two pairs (suffix -X for new ones), where the
	  -X macros are suitable for calling in the function
	  wam_unify(f1, f2) occurring outside the context of run_wam
	  and its definition of the 6 shadow registers.

	* Converted array-based processing loop in int_net.c to 
	  list-processing-from-C approach (suggested by Bill Older).
