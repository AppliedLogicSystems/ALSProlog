A systematic approach to internal debugging (ie, placement of printf statements)
has been adopted (though it hasn't been propagated through all portions of the 
code yet.)  To use these facilities, one must add the following to the
tconfig.h configuration file in the build directory:

#define DEBUGSYS 1

By itself, this has no perceptible effect.  However, it makes it possible to
selectively turn various C-level printf statments on and off in the resulting 
runtime system.  The control over these is exercised by several predicates 
in the builtins file blt_sys.pro:

debug_sys_features/2 -- the database of features controlled

toggle_system_debug/1 -- turns a feature on/off.

As of this writing, debug_sys_features/2 consists of:

debug_sys_features(gcbeep,      0).
debug_sys_features(gcinfo,      1).
debug_sys_features(freezeinfo,  2).
debug_sys_features(cstrprim,    3).
debug_sys_features(cstrchng,    4).
debug_sys_features(cstrupdt,    5).
debug_sys_features(cstruptm,    6).
debug_sys_features(cstrupad,    7).
debug_sys_features(cstrupxt,    8).
debug_sys_features(gcintr,      9).
debug_sys_features(cstrbpuf,    10).
debug_sys_features(frezbv,      11).
debug_sys_features(cut_rsb,     12).
debug_sys_features(cut_cpctr,   13).

Submitting a goal

	toggle_system_debug(WhichFeat)

will toggle the printing for that feature on/off. The special goal

	toggle_system_debug(cstr)

is a shorthand for:

		toggle_system_debug(cstrprim),
		toggle_system_debug(cstrchng),
		toggle_system_debug(cstrupdt),
		toggle_system_debug(cstruptm),
		toggle_system_debug(cstrupad),
		toggle_system_debug(cstrupxt),
		toggle_system_debug(cstrbpuf).

Knowing which feature prints what, of course, is desirable.  In the absence of
written documentation, here's how to find out.  First, in ~generic/debugsys.h,
the following typedef enum occurs:

typedef enum {
	GCBEEP,         /* gcbeep       (0)     */
	GCINFO,         /* gcinfo       (1)     */
	FREEZEINFO,     /* freezeinfo   (2)     */
	CSTRPRIM,       /* cstrprim     (3)     */
	CSTRCHNG,       /* cstrchng     (4)     */
	CSTRUPDT,       /* cstrupdt     (5)     */
	CSTRUPTM,       /* cstruptm     (6)     */
	CSTRUPAD,       /* cstrupad     (7)     */
	CSTRUPXT,       /* cstrupxt     (8)     */
	GCINTR,         /* gcintr       (9)     */
	CSTRBPUF,       /* cstrbpuf     (10)    */
	FREZBV,         /* frezbv       (11)    */
	CUT_RSB,        /* cut_rsb      (12)    */
	CUT_CPCTR,      /* cut_cpctr    (13)    */
	MAX_DEBUG_FEATS
	} debug_feats;

[Adding a new debug feature requires adding an entry here, together with the
corresponding entry in blt_sys.pro.]

Now just use grep to perform a search for the target feature:

hilbert% grep GCBEEP *.c
gc.c:   if (debug_system[GCBEEP]) {

Note that all of the CSTR<*> features control information for CLP(BNR) in
the file int_net.c.
