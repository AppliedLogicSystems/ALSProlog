Prior to 1993, we weren't very careful about documenting the changes
made to ALS-Prolog.  Still, there was a period when we did some of this.
The following is a record of changes made (mostly) prior to 1993. 

Merge Source Changes

1-26-90		tokini.h			kev
	callWithDelayedInterrupt was not defined.  Replaced ocall with
	callWithDelayedInterrupt

1-30-90		wintcode.c			kev
	The function decr_icount needed calls to makewritable and makerunable

1-25-90		built.c				kev
	The Motorola numeric primitives were added in with #ifdef MotorolaMath
	around them MotorolaMath should be defined in config.h if these math
	primitives are available

1-26-90		bdb.c				kev
	The macro MTP_CONSTTAG is used in pbi_firstargkey.  The source was
	ifdefed to do the appropriate thing if MTP_CONSTTAG is not defined
	(as on the 88k).

1-26-90		bsystem.c			kev
	SUCCEED was not present at the end of pbi_ouch, pbi_showanswers,
	pbi_printno, pbi_printwarning, and pbi_statistics.  It was added to
	each.

1-31-90		loadfile.c			kev (for Ilyas)
	Ilyas suggested that errno.h not be include on DOS systems. The
	errno.h include was therefore moved into the #else part of a DOS
	#ifdef.

1-31-90		expand.c			kev
	Removed the function (and its calls) extract_module_from_head.  This
	was formerly used in very early versions to assert things into 
	different modules

1-31-90		dcgs.pro			kev
	Cut added in expand_/3 to force determinacy.  Cut removed in dcg_expand
	(after head) because it didn't do anything.

1-31-90		bdb.c				kev
	pbi_asserta and pbi_assertz -- calls to change_module removed.  Calls
	to icode(IC_NEWMODULE...) and IC_ENDMODULE added.  These changes were
	make to get the nesting to work properly.

1-31-90		icom.h				kev
	#define for change_module removed.

1-31-90		foreign.c			kev
	placement of end_mod call changed so that nesting would work properly.

1-31-90		module.h			kev
	cur_mod change to a #define.
	declaration for top_module added (as an extern)

1-31-90		module.c			kev
	top_module declaration added.  Code added and changed to permit
	module nesting.

2-1-90		loadfile.c			kev
	OBP file version number changed to force recompilation of .pro files.
	New nesting stuff sometimes messes up with old .obp files.

------	[Tape sent to Syracuse]

2-2-90		compile.h			kev
	SPREG changed from 31 to 23 in order to separate Prolog's stack pointer
	from C's stack pointer (it was too much of a hassle figuring out
	how to keep Prolog's stuff double word aligned).  Placement of last
	temporary register also changed. (S takes the place of T5.)  This
	took place in an m88k ifdef so it should not affect other
	implementations.


2-8-90		bdb.c				kev
	Bug introduced when module nesting code added in assertz and asserta.
	Goals in clause did not always call proper module.  Code rearranged
	somewhat to work properly.

2-10-90		debugger.pro			kev
	When tracing a setof which generates more than one solution, upon
	attempting to see the second (or third, etc) solution, the debugger
	would backtrack into (and display) certain builtins.  A change was
	made to dogoal and exitOrRedo to stop this from happening.

2-12-90		main.c				kev
	main_cntrl_c_handler changed so that it will not set the Safety value
	at top level

2-12-90		fileio.c			kev
	Assignment of 0 to wm_interrupt_caught removed.

2-13-90		fileio.c			kev
	Assignment of 0 to wm_interrupt_caught put back in.  But we
	do an additional check in the condition so that this will not be
	done unless at the top level.  I had some trouble on the Motorola
	system with this.  We can not handle the problem in the control-C
	handler since the system service (fgets) will not restart by itself
	on system V.  We need to set a flag which indicates that the interrupt
	has been seen.  So my strategy is to ignore the top level control-C's.
	All others (such as a consult of user) will (on System V) cause an
	abort back to the query level.  I like this behavior and will take
	pains to make it work the same way on the Sun.

------	[Tape received from Syracuse]

1-29-90 	bmisc.c
		"termcmp" routine is changed to handle double numbers and lists.


2-7-90 		builtins.pro 
		The last clause of $interrupt/3 is changed.
		The module closure of callWithDelayedInterrupt is defined.

2-7-90 		blt_io.pro
		The file "vsubst.pro" is updated to use my version of varsubst/3
		and the predicate varsubst/3 is moved into the file "blt_io.pro".
		The file "vsubst.pro" is deleted. And some more changes in comments.
			
2-7-90 		blt_sys.pro
		all_ntbl_entries/4 is exported.
		clauses/4 is added.
		ls, cd and dir predicates are rearranged.


2-8-90 		bmeta.c
		pbi_true and pbi_equal are added. 
			
2-8-90  	arith.c
		pbi_time is added.

2-8-90 		built.c
		true, equal, and $time is defined.


2-9-90 		bdb.c
		I am keeping #ifdef CodeGC in the function pbi_collectcode.
		This is necessary since the function w_collect is
		not defined.

2-9-90  	bgv.c
		Functions pbi_gv_get and pbi_gv_set check boundary conditions.

2-9-90 		intinit.c
		Unnecessary lines are deleted.

2-9-90 		gv.h
		This file is completely deleted.

2-9-90 		winter.h
		The "extern" definition of wm_magic is deleted.
		The name of the file "interface.h" is changed to "wint88.h".

2-9-90 		winter.c	
		The definition of wm_magic is deleted.
		
2-9-90 		wint88.h
		The file "interface.h: is copied into the generic directory, and
		its name is changed to "wint88.h".


2-12-90 	gv.c 
		The initial value of wm_gvfreelist is the prolog constant -1.
		The function fixptrs is changed.

2-12-90 	fileio.c
		The line "wm_interrupt_caught=0;" in the function fio_nxln is deleted.
	

Note:
		My "main.c" asserts facts of the predicate "searchdir".
		
------	[Above changes are by Ilyas]

2-13-90		system				kev
	Merged above changes by Ilyas into my version.  Fixed an error in
	pbi_time sent by Ilyas (it would not compile).  Left fileio.c
	as is in my version (see above comment for 2-13).  bdb.c also had
	some significant changes of my doing in it. Other than that, was
	able to simply copy files which were different.

2-14-90		arith.c and built.c		kev
	Ilyas sent me new versions to get a better $time.

2-15-90		blt_sys.pro			kev
	Changed way that debugger is loaded slightly so that abolishes are
	not performed from this file.  They are now performed by the debugger.

2-15-90		debugger.pro			kev
	Put a command to abolish trace, spy, and others at beginning of file
	so that -d command line switch will work properly.

2-15-90		main.c				kev
	Autoload changed so that load_file is called in consult rather than
	reconsult mode.  This was changed so that the -d would work properly.
	The $ALSPATH stuff was also copied from Ilyas's main.c to this one.

2-15-90		wintcode.h			kev
	NMSK_RECONSULT renamed to NMSK_PERMANENT (for a different purpose).
	The use of a reconsult bit dates back to the days of the PC.  The
	present method of reconsulting is better (a reconsult nested within
	a consult nested in a reconsult will work properly).  It uses
	timestamps.  What I am trying to say here is that NMSK_RECONSULT is
	no longer used and hasn't been since the days of the PC Prolog.  So it
	is safe to rename it.

	NMSK_PERMANENT will be used for ','/2, ';'/2, etc to indicate
	control predicates which are permanent (should not be modified).

2-15-90		module.c			kev
	NMSK_PERMANENT used in new_mod for initializing the control predicates.


2-18-90		bdb.c				kev
	pbi_resolve_module ($resolve_module/4 from Prolog) added back in.  This
	is necessary to get desirable behavior out of the debugger.

2-18-90		debugger.pro			kev
	Changed the way execute/3 works.  1) Attempting to trace clause or
	retract either doesn't work or gives unexpected results due to
	interaction of debugger interrupts and interrupts used in implementing
	the decompiler.  2) (This is more minor, but still annoying)...
	Attempting to trace any builtin defined in Prolog will sometimes bring 
	you part way into the builtin because the initial call might be from
	user.  We need to know whether or not the predicate being called 
	eventually resolves to the builtins module (hence the need for 
	$resolve_module/4).  So execute/3 now separates the behavior of 
	certain types of builtins and also calls $resolve_module/4.

-------	[Tape sent to Syracuse on 2/19/90]

2-20-90		wintcode.c			kev
	Took out extraneous line of code in the code space garbage collector.
	This piece of code concerned itself with computing the clause address
	and did not use macros.  When I put the code in for using macros, I 
	forgot to remove the old one.  As a result, the assignment was done
	twice (incorrectly on the 88k the first time).

2-22-90		wintcode.c			kev
	It turned out that there was more wrong with the code space garbage
	collector.  I must have been asleep when I initially wrote the
	heap marking code because the part of the code which looks for
	database references never ran!   There was also a BIAS problem for
	the 88k which I fixed.

2-27-90		wintcode.c			kev
	Ilyas told me about an fprintf whose first argument was not a file
	descriptor.  I fixed it to work right.  Ilyas also told me about
	abolish and reconsult which did not use the code space garbage 
	collector stuff.

2-28-90		wintcode.c			kev
	Fixed the problem with abolish and reconsult so that they now call
	w_freeclause instead of w_freecode directly.  This way the code
	space garbage collector must free up code removed by abolish or
	retract.  It is now possible to reconsult the builtins without
	core dumping.  It is probably still not a good idea to do it though.
	I suspect that the interrupt stuff might get screwed up.

3-2-90		wintcode.c			kev
	Removed a debugging printf which I had put in a few days ago and forgot
	to remove.  This printf was in w_collect.

3-2-90		wntbl.h				kev
	Value for NTBL_CODESIZE on the 88k changed from 24 to 19.  Sam and
	Craig at Motorola were noticing that the performance had dropped
	between version 0.05 (before the merge) to the current ones (after
	the merge).  The only way I could explain it was that the (code) cache
	was behaving differently.  I found that the actual size of a procedure
	entry on the 88k decreased between versions and that things were
	no longer double word aligned.  I reviewed the switch code which
	goes into the procedure entry (this is what determines how big the
	code section must be) and found that the old value needed to be
	24 due to the tb1 instructions required by the silicon filter.  I
	think that we can actually change NTBL_CODESIZE to 17, but chose
	19 because it gives us a couple of words to spare.  18 could be
	used, but things will not end up double word aligned.  Craig reran
	a few benchmarks and noted some improvement.  They may study this
	issue in depth sometime in the future.

3-7-90		compile.h			kev
	Added in #defines for the sparc and vax.  This file should probably 
	be made a system specific version.  It does have the advantage (as is),
	however, of being able to compare the differences in implementations
	at a glance.

3-7-90		built.h				kev
	Changed the value of UIA_MAX to be the same as PBI_NAMEMAX.  The
	guys at Motorola were noticing a problem.


-------	[Tape received from Syracuse on 3/13/90]


arith.c 	2-13-90				Ilyas
		The function "pbi_time" is fixed.
		The function "do_is" is rewritten.


built.c 	2-13-90				Ilyas
		Entry for the function "pbi_time" is fixed.


vprintf.c 	2-26-90				Ilyas
		The order of include files "fileio.h" and "vprintf.h" in this file
		is  changed, since it has been giving syntax error in SysV.
		The reason for this syntax error is that we were changing some
		definitions in "stdio.h" which is included in the file "fileio.h".

wintcode.c 	3-2-90				Ilyas
		The function "mark_from_retaddr" is changed, so that I386 system
		can use that function.

------	[Above changes merged in and both copies checked for differences]

3-13-90		arith.c				kev
	Fixed the tabs in the new version and made comparison of numbers
	slightly more efficient.

3-14-90		gc.c				kev
	Added trail compaction of heap pointers to the garbage compactor. This
	change was needed because global variables in conjunction with cut
	can create trail garbage.

3-15-90		main.c				kev & ken
	makerunable and makewritable pairs added before and after call to
	prolog_consult.

3-15-90		wintcode.c			kev
	makewritable and makerunable calls now encompass a wider range of code
	in decr_icount.

3-15-90		bdb.c				kev
	makewritable and makerunable calls now encompass a wider range of code
	in doassert.

3-29-90		wntbl.h				kev
	Moved a comment and added declarations for the VAX implementation.

3-30-90		chpt.h				kev
	Added in declarations for the vax implementation.

3-30-90		types.h				kev
	Added in declarations for vax and sparc implementations.

3-30-90		wci.h				kev
	Added in declarations for the vax.

3-30-90		arith.c				kev
	#include for config.h moved after #includes for system .h files
	because vax was messing things up (multiple defn's).  As a rule,
	all of our .h files should come after the system .h files so we
	don't mess anything up.

4-6-90		wdisp.c				kev
	Modified printing of floating point numbers so that we can print
	32 bit integer values which are doubles.  These will now print as 
	an integer; things such as 1<<31.  They used to come out in 
	scientific notation.
4-18-90		main.c				kev
	Using -g in conjunction with -p caused core dumps due to argument
	counter (i) not being decremented in the loop which reads in switchs
	(on -g option only).  Decrement statement put in.
5-24-90		wintcode.c			kev
	Removed #ifdef spy #endif pair around w_spy and w_nospy.  These were
	giving an linker errors since w_spy and w_nospy are called from the
	builtins.  Keith got kind of carried away with ifdefing out sections
	of code.  (Or else he didn't go far enough).  My own personal
	preference is to have as few ifdefs as possible.

	#ifdefs around rewind statements are removed. Those rewind statements
	are required in DOS and SunOS operating systems, and don't make any
	harm in other operating systems.


parser.c 	5-29-90
	#ifdefs around rewind statements are removed. Those rewind statements
	are required in DOS and SunOS operating systems, and don't make any
	harm in other operating systems.

-------	[Above changes merged into system]

6-8-90		fileio.c			kev
	Code added to handle the printing of syntax errors.  Some code previously
	ifdefed out was put back.

6-8-90		parser.c			kev
	Code added/removed to/from parser.c to handle the printing of syntax
	errors.  Actually, some of the code was moved from the parser to
	fileio.c (see above).

6-11-90		wintcode.c			kev
	Ilyas had commented out a line that made chat core dump when reconsulting
	(for the 386 system).  Even with this line commented out, the 68020
	system died.  This line performed a useful purpose and was uncommented.
	It turned out that the stack frames between different prolog contexts
	were not set up properly and this problem has been fixed (at least
	for this problem) on the 88k and 68k versions.

6-12-90		bmeta.c				kev
	pbi_mangle changed so that the gc compaction bit (located in the
	SPB field of a choice point is cleared when doing a choice point
	stack walk.  This will cause garbage created by mangle to be
	collected.  This might fix Ken's recent problem that he had.
	The corresponding assembly code for 68k and 88k systems was
	also corrected in the same manner.

------The following changes were made while kev was in Syracuse and were
------entered after the fact.

7-30-90		wintcode.c			kev
	Keith's AUTOINDEXING ifdef really pissed me off while doing the vax port
	so I removed it.  All it did was ifdef out code that my assembly
	language routines needed to call giving some linking errors.  Keith
	really went overboard with his ifdefs.
	
	If AUTOINDEXING is not defined (as it isn't at this point in the VAX
	port), nothing untoward will happen.  Keith did what he did to make
	the image as small a possible, but if all implementations will 
	eventually implement autoindexing anyway, there is no harm in including
	it in the compilation during development.

7-30-90		vprintf.h			kev
	This file will eventually be removed.  For now, it has a comment
	in it stating something to this effect.

7-30-90		vprintf.c			kev
	The old vprintf code is finally all gone and is replaced with
	a varargs version called PI_printf (vprintf is actually a library
	function which conflicts with our name).  This means that the
	remaining three files in the 88k merge that weren't merged soon will
	be.  All of the files which called vprintf or vputchar or vputdouble
	are now changed to call (respectively) PI_printf, PI_putchar, and
	PI_putdouble (there is no longer a need for vputdouble).

7-30-90		main.c				kev
	fio_init call added to do some initializations that Raman needed
	to get the portable system to port to all machines.

	als_exit(0) added to the end of main.c to keep it from erroring out
	of make.  Apparently, system V compatability means that things will
	error out of make unless there is an explicit exit(0) placed in the
	code.  (I have not seen documentation to this effect, however).

	Code was added to handle VMS pathnames.  It probably is still not
	totally right, but it is a start.

7-30-90		fileio.c			kev
	fio_init function added to do some initializations that used to be
	done at compile time.  These aren't terribly computationally intensive
	so I am not worried about them affecting startup time all that much.

------	Ilyas sent me a tape which I merged in around 9-24-90
------	I didn't see a changes file

8-27-90		bmeta.c				kev
	mangle changed to increment gv_setcnt.  These changes were also
	made in functor.vax, and functor.68k in the assembly implementations.
	This will cause the garabage collector to collect more stuff when
	a mangle is performed.


9-25-90		alspi.h				kev
	PI_BEGIN definition changed to include static.  This will permit
	more than one PI_BEGIN / PI_END sequence in an image (but at most
	one sequence per file).

9-26-90		compmath.c			kev
	Ilyas had changed compmath.c so that the 386 now has compiled
	Arithmetic.  The 68k implementation did not.  Some of the
	ifdefs reflecting this fact were removed.  At the present time,
	there is only one ifdef dealing with the fact that xor is not
	implemented yet on the 88k.

9-28-90		alspi.h				kev
	A declaration of a dummy static variable (___dummy___) was added
	at the end of this file.  There was a problem with dynamic linking
	on the 88k -- it needed a .bss section for things to work properly.
	In most circumstances, a .bss section is created as a result of
	the code that implements the foreign interface application.  But on
	some of the simplest examples (hello.c for one), a .bss section was
	not created and dynamic linking chokes.




--- I remerged the system after I got the tape from Kevin -- Ilyas 10/8/90 ---
--- Following changes were made in the current system ---

10-15-90 	all related files
	All processor flags are changed. We put 'als_' prefix for these
	flags. For example, we use 'als_m68k' instead of 'm68k'.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


	I merged the directory 'Merge2' (we got it from Kevin on 5/14/91) with
my directory 'ilyas/Merge' (it contains packing stuff).

Date: 5/24/91

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Its time we revived this form of documentation of changes to the system.
We should also include in this list any bugs that were fixed and a brief
description of the pathological behaviour and what was done to fix it.
This is useful because often a bug that was fixed in one system reappears
in the same or another system, and this record will be of great help.


2-25-93	:	pckgmake.h (for als_sparc )

BUG		: 	The packaged image dumps core when attempting to do indexing.
FIX		:	The code area size in the name table entry in the packaged code
			was smaller than needed for switch-on-term. This mismatch happened
			because in the coff macros the size and offsets of name table
			components are hard-coded and these were not updated when
			the sizes were changed in wintcode.h. The coff macros should be
			fixed to use the constants defined in wintcode.h.

3-1-93	:	bpckg.c built.c pckgcoff.h pckgcoff.c blt_pckg.pro mkpckg.pro

UPDATE	:	The raw data area is stored in a file instead of memory. This
			was needed to be able to package large amount of code.


3-8-93	:	SPARC/icode2.c

BUG		:	Packaged image of the alsdev development environment dumps core
			when executing switch-on-term on a procedure with catch-all clause.
FIX		:	The switch-on-term tries to suck instructions from the clause
			code to fille any delay slots. However, this should not be done
			when the code pointed to involves a branch of any kind. The check
			was being done for call and branch but not for jmp and thsi was fixed.


3-11-93	:	??? ( I wish I had documented this the first time I saw it)

BUG		:	On NeXT when running pro2c interface generator, a deep recursive
			call (sort_by_arity/2) fails after doing 2 gc's.
FIX		:	none yet.


4-15-93	:	SPARC

BUG		:	packaged code dumps core when doing pckg_gvar_init
FIX		:	(I saw this one before. Again I wish I had documented the fix).
