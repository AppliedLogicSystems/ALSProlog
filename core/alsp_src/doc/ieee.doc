The IEEE floating point standard provides for two useful extensions,
"+/-Infinity" (positive and negative infinity), and NAN (not a number).

These are (or shortly will be) supported in ALS Prolog, and in CLP(BNR),
in particular providing for infinite intervals.  The declaration
X::real then will have the effect of associating X with the interval
	[-Infinity, +Infinity]

These entities are allowed in Prolog expressions using the following
syntax:

NAN:          0nan or 0n

+Infinity:    0inf or 0i

-Infinity:    -0inf or -0i

[In building the system, one currently needs to add

#define USE_IEEE_FP 1

to the configuration file tconfig.h in the build directory. ]
