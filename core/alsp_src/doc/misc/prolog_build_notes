PROLOG-BUILD-NOTES 	-- Notes on how to build ALS-Prolog  on
			   various platforms


Pre-build steps:
---------------

In bash, do the following prior to doing any build (some systems need it, some
don't -- largely dependent on the size and number of the system include files
which must be examined while building the X and Motif interfaces.)

	ALS_OPTIONS=heap_size:8000 ; export ALS_OPTIONS

Create the build directory.  I usually use the name of the packaged suffixed
with a '-' and then the name of the host.   For example,

	mkdir /max4/pk-max

Then cd to the build directory, e.g,

	cd /max4/pk-max


Building ALS-Prolog
-------------------

Suppose the source resides in /max4/kev/pk-940913.  Issue the following
commands.

	/max4/kev/pk-940913/configure
	make

Depending on the system, it may be necessary to set some environment
variables prior to running either the configure script or the make.  See
below for actual examples.  On some machines, the above two steps will not
work flawlessly.  It may be necessary to edit Makefile in one of

	bld-port		(byte-code and threaded code)
	bld-natv		(native code)
	bld-wins/x		(bld-port or bld-natv plus X)
	bld-wins/motif		(bld-port or bld-natv plus X + Motif)

Note that editing one of these makefiles will not affect the original
source code.  If you wish to effect more permanent changes, you will
need to modify one of the makefile templates (Makefile.in) or one
of the makefile headers (mh-*) in the source tree.

If you make permanent changes, then send your changes back to Applied Logic
Systems (ken@als.com) preferably in the form of diffs, either unidiffs (diff
-u) or context diffs (diff -c).  You can ask Ken which variety he prefers.


Post-build steps:
----------------

If an image called alsXpro is desired, then do the following:

	cd bld-wins/motif
	alspro_motif -g "assert(als_motif_loaded), save_image(alsXpro)"

If this works properly, you should be left with an alsXpro image
which may then be moved to an installation directory, e.g.,
/usr/local/bin

Comments:

	Note that if the Motif include files and library files were to be
	put in the standard places, most of the above nonsense would not be
	necessary.  (Hint, hint).

	It will be necessary to have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set properly on this
	system.

	          -D__ARCHITECTURE__=m68k -D_NEXT_SOURCE" \
	make


Comments:

	The XDEFINES environment variable will cause the specified switches
	to be passed to the interface generator.  This is (unfortunately)
	necessary because 1) NeXT put the system include files in
	non-standard places and 2) NeXT uses a non-standard mechanism for
	including files.  It could be argued that these approaches are
	better, but it would be nice if NeXT would have provided a mechanism
	for determining the initial set of C preprocessor defines.  If this
	were done, we could automate the above step of setting XDEFINES.

Comments:

	The als-mics program does not work (it core dumps) on this platform. 
	Thus it will be impossible to package the builtins.  This will be
	a problem until SGI fixes the elf library (/usr/lib/libelf.a).

	Note that we had to play a similar trick with XDEFINES as on the
	NeXT.  The include files are in the normal places.  The difference
	is that some of the include files reference some of the predefined
	macro defns and fail to perform all of the typedefs necessary for
	the build to succeed without them.

		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

		X_CFLAGS=-I/usr/include X_LIBS=-L/usr/lib \
		../pk-940913/configure

		make

Comments:

	The X_CFLAGS line is needed for the configure because the
	system administrators forgot to rebuild the fixed include files
	for gcc after they'd installed X11R5 and Motif1.2.  Doing this
	sort of thing is normally not a good idea, but it is necessary
	here in order to avoid mixing some X11R4 include files (the
	ones which gcc has fixed) with new X11R5 include files.

	Note that the correct way to fix this problem is to get the
	system administrators to rebuild gcc's include files.

	The reason for setting X_LIBS on this machine is to force /usr/lib
	to be looked at first before any other library locations.  This
	machine is a Sparc running SunOS4.1.3, but (as noted above) has been
	upgraded to X11R5 and Motif1.2.  There is still a directory which
	is normally searched first which has Sun's old openwindows libraries
	in it.  These libraries are X11R4 and are incompatible with the
	include files located in /usr/include/X11 on this machine.
