Macintosh ALS Prolog Build InstructionsAuthor: Chuck HouptDate: 1-April-1996These instructions assume that the ALS Prolog source directory exists, and all of its generated files are up to date (for example: generated makefiles, headers, etc).  The ALS Prolog source directory is refered to as {srcdir} in this document.Build Materials:¥ Macintosh (68k or PowerPC) with at least 15 MB of available memory and at least 150 MB of available disk space.¥ Metrowerk's Code Warrior Gold 8 with the following options and modifications:     - Install with at least these two packages:          - Macintosh Programmer's Workshop          - Metrowerks MPW Tools for MacOS     - Copy the MPW script MakeIt from {srcdir}port:macos: to {MPW}Scripts:¥ Code Warrior Grand Unified Socket Interface Library (CWGUSI) 1.7    Freeware by Matthias Neeracher (neeri@iis.ee.ethz.ch)    Available from http://err.ethz.ch/members/neeri/macintosh.html    Install CWGUSI as follows:          - Create the directories {MPW}Interfaces:GUSIIncludes:            and {MPW}Libraries:GUSILibraries:          - copy :GUSI:include and :GUSI:Lib into the two newly created directories.Build Instructions:1. Create a build directory, which will be refered to as {blddir}2. Launch MPW, and run the bd_mac script with the command line below:    {srcdir}bd_mac {srcdir} {blddir}Here is a description of bd_mac:    bd_mac source_director build_directorybd_mac is a MPW script that takes two directories as arguments.  source_directory is the ALS Prolog source directory ({srcdir}) and build_directory is the build directory created in step 1 ({blddir}).  bd_mac creates all the necessary directories and files  for a build in build_directory. 3. Set MPW's working directory to {blddir}bld-port:4. Execute the MakeIt script.  No Errors should be displayed during the build process.Files generated:Alspro libararies:alspro.ppc.libalspro.68k.libStand alone TTY applications:sioux_alspro_b_ppcsioux_alspro_b_68ksioux_alspro_b (Fat Binary)MPW Tools:mpw_alspro_b_ppcmpw_alspro_b_68kmpw_alspro_b (Fat Binary)alspro_b (duplicate of mpw_alspro_b for use in test scripts)
