Building
--------

For building with Metrowerks, please see the combined MacOS/Win32
build instructions in ../mwbuild/Build_Instructions.

Testing
-------

Currently run test programs by hand.

Programming Eve3 Hardware Keys
------------------------------

Simple keys do not need to be programmed, because key are
shipped from the factory with all-zero registers.

30-Day Demo keys can be created by using the Eve3 Editor
and the "{srcdir}bin:Eve 30-Day Demo Setup" file.


Building Standard ALS Prolog Installer
--------------------------------------

Set up the files with the following organization:

ALS Prolog X.X Folder
	Read Me
	ALS Prolog X.X
	ALS Prolog Library
	alsdir
		builtins
		libraries
		shared
			<tcltk files>
			<odbc files>
			<macos interface files>
	Manual
	Examples
	Foreign Interface SDK

Position all the files and folders to present a neat and consistent appearance.

Make a copy of the installer template (from alsp_src/macos/installer_template.hqx)
Add the "ALS Prolog X.X Folder" to the installer template.

Build both a network (single file) installer and high density disk size
segmented installer. Place the segments on a series of disks named:

ALS Prolog Installer Disk 1
ALS Prolog Installer Disk 2
ALS Prolog Installer Disk 3
...etc...

Make sure that disk 1 is always open when mounted.  The open disk 1 window
should be positioned in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.  The window
size should be just large enough to display the title and the installer icon.
The installer icon should be located in the middle of the window.

The rest of the disk should be closed when mounted.

Archive the disks as Read Only disk images.

The utility "Disk Copy" can be used to create disk images without using real
disks.
