# Unused warning options and why:

#-Wshadow - We use shadow variables - should be fixed someday.
#-Wcast-qual - We force some cast qualifiers - should be fixed someday.
#-Wcast-align - This reports many, many warnings. Is this a real problem?
#-Wconversion - We always have prototypes, so this is not a concern.
#-Waggregate-return - We use aggregate types.
#-Wredundant-decls - Most redundant declarations are in system header files,
#		     but there is some in our code, too. Fix someday.
# -Wstrict-prototypes - Complains about arg-less function pointer like:
#                       int (*func)(), which I think are legal.

# -Wno-trigraphs added to avoid warnings for Apple '????'-style constants.

# -Wno-unused-result -Wno-unused-but-set-variable - Fix someday.
