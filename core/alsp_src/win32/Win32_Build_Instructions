Building
--------

For building with Metrowerks, please see the combined MacOS/Win32
build instructions in ../mwbuild/Build_Instructions.

Testing
-------

- To test the portable version, from Bash on Win95/NT, run the testrun.sh
  script.
  
  Example: % ./testrun.sh
  
   with the change the directory to

- To test the demo version, run demo_alspro_b and demo_alspro, both with
  and without the hardware key - the demo should not run without the
  hardware key.  Also test by removing the hardware key while in the
  prolog shell, and execute a query - this should cause the program to
  halt when it cannot detect the hardware key.

- To test the DLL, run testdll.exe. Successfully running testdll.exe is enough to
  test the DLL. Repeat this test for demo_testdll.exe, testing both with and
  without the hardware key.

Programming Sentinel UniKey Hardware Keys
-----------------------------------------

Both simple and 30-Day demo keys need programming. To program the keys, use the
prog_ssikey program.

The prog_ssikey program is stored in the archive {srcdir}bin:SSI Key
Programmer.sit.hqx.  Unpack the archive and run prog_ssikey.exe.  This will
display usage information.
