Microsoft Win32 x86 ALS Prolog Build Instructions
=================================================
Author: Chuck Houpt Date: 4-June-1997

These instructions assume that the ALS Prolog source directory exists, and all of
its generated files are up to date. The ALS Prolog source directory is refered
to as $SRCDIR, %SRCDIR% or {blddir} in this document.

Build Materials:
----------------

- Macintosh (68k or PowerPC) with at least 15 MB of available memory
and at least 150 MB of available disk space.

- x86 Windows95 or WindowsNT machine with at least X MB of memory and
at least Y MB of available disk space.

- Unix system.

- Metrowerk's Code Warrior Gold 10 with the following options and
modifications:
    - Install with at least this option: Metrowerks x86 C/C++ Compiler
      and the Other Metrowerks Tools folder (for the Metrowerks Standard Library).
    - ALS modifications to the Metrowerks Standard Library.
    - ALS modifications to the Metrowerks C Runtime Library.
    - 
- Software Security Inc.'s UniKey Library
	- Put a "UniKey Library" folder with ssicm32n.lib and ssi_cw32.h in
	  the Win32/x86 Support folder.

Build Instructions:
-------------------

A note of access paths:

The Metrowerks projects will need to have their access paths adjusted if 
the name of the ALS Prolog source directory has changed.

To change the access paths for a project, select "Preferences..." from
the Edit menu to open the preferences dialog.  In the preferences dialog,
click on the access paths icon, and to see the current paths.

Only the User paths that reference the ALS Prolog source tree will need
adjusting.  To change a path, click-select it and press the "Change"
button.  Use the standard file dialog box to navigate to the correct
directory.

A note on DOS batch files:

All the DOS batch files assume that the environment variable %ALSP_SRC%
is set to the ALS Prolog source directory. Execute the following command
before running any of the batch files:

set ALSP_SRC=x:\yyyyy\zzzz

Build Steps:
------------

1. From Unix, create a directory for the new build. Run the shell script
win32_setup in the new directory:

	$SRCDIR/win32/win32_setup $SRCDIR
	
2. On the Mac, decode and extract the project files int the build directory
using Stuffit Expander.  The following projects need expanding:

	alspro_lib.prj.sit.hqx
	alspro_b.prj.sit.hqx
	alspro_dll.prj.sit.hqx
	testdll.x86.prj.sit.hqx
	Build_Win32.sit.hqx
	
3. On the Mac, run the AppleScript Application "Build_Win32" to build
all the projects.

Each project may need to have its access paths adjusted, see the note above.

4. From MS-DOS, set the ALSP_SRC environment variable.

5. From MS-DOS, change the directory to %BLDDIR%\bld-port, and run the
batch file package.bat.

Testing
-------

- To test the portable version, from MS-DOS, change the directory to
%BLDDIR%\bld-port and run the batch file "testrun.bat".

Note testrun requires that the ALSP_SRC environment variable is properly
set.

- To test the demo version, run demo_alspro_b and demo_alspro, both with
  and without the hardware key - the demo should not run without the
  hardware key.  Also test by removing the hardware key while in the
  prolog shell, and execute a query - this should cause the program to
  halt when it cannot detect the hardware key.

- To test the DLL, run testdll.exe. Successfully running testdll.exe is enough to
  test the DLL. Repeat this test for demo_testdll.exe, testing both with and
  without the hardware key.

Files generated:
----------------

Static extensable development system libraries:

{blddir}bld-port:alspro_d.lib
{blddir}bld-port:demo_alspro_d.lib

Static embedable prolog engine libraries:

{blddir}bld-port:alspro.lib
{blddir}bld-port:demo_alspro.lib

Dynamic embedable prolog engine libraries:

{blddir}bld-port:alspro.dll
{blddir}bld-port:alspro.dll.lib
{blddir}bld-port:demo_alspro.dll
{blddir}bld-port:demo_alspro.dll.lib

Console application:

{blddir}bld-port:alspro_b.exe
{blddir}bld-port:alspro.exe

{blddir}bld-port:demo_alspro_b.exe
{blddir}bld-port:demo_alspro.exe

Programming Sentinel UniKey Hardware Keys
-----------------------------------------

Both simple and 30-Day demo keys need programming. To program the keys, use the
prog_ssikey program.

The prog_ssikey program is stored in the archive {srcdir}bin:SSI Key
Programmer.sit.hqx.  Unpack the archive and run prog_ssikey.exe.  This will
display usage information.
