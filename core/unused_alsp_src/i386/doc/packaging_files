Packaging Files
===============


pckgdis.c
	This file contains packaging disassembler routines.

	The top level routine is "pckg_listasm" which disassemblies
	386 instructions produced by the ALS-Prolog compiler. 
	This routine is called by routines "listasm_ntblentry" and
	"listasm_clause" in the file "pckgmake.c" to disassembly
	certain parts of name table entries and clauses.

	The other important routine in this file is "resolveaddr"
	This routine produce a symbolic name for a given address.
	This symbolic name can be:
		a. A name of a global variable which can occur in code 
		   produced by the compiler such as "wm_heapbase" 
		   and "wm_safety".
		b. A name of a procedure which can occur in code produced by
		   the compiler such as "wm_exec" and "pbi_is".
		c. A symbolic name to represents certain entry points of
		   disassemblied name table entries and clauses.
		   For example, "test_2122bb_call" represents the call
		   entry of a procedure (whose location was 2122bb) in 
		   the package "test".


pckgmake.c
	Main routines in this file are "listasm_ntblentry" and 
	"listasm_clause". They are responsible to produce disassemblied
	name table entries and clauses, respectively.


pckgload.c
	Routines in this file are responsible to load packages linked with
	ALS-Prolog library. There are tree main routines in this file.
		1. The routine "pckg_toktbl_init" initialize the system 
		   token table from the package token table.
		2. The routine "pckg_modtbl_init" initializes system tables
		   module table, default use table and default procedure
		   tables from tables in the package.
		3. The routine "pckg_ntbl_init" initializes the system
		    name table table from package name tables.

bpckg.c 
	This file contains new Prolog builtins defined in C for the packaging
	system. These builtins are as follows:

	$listasm_clause(DBRef,PckgName)
		Disassembly the given clause. PckgName will be used when
		the disassembler produces symbolic names for clause entries.
	$listasm_ntblentry(Module,Pred,Arity,PckgName)
		Disassembly the name table entry of the given predicate.
        $ntblentry(Module,Pred,Arity)
		Print the address of the name table entry of the given
		predicate in hexadecimal format. This is used when Prolog
		side of the packaging system produce symbolic names.
	$package_toktbl(NumofToks)
		Save the current token table in the package.
	$package_external_defs
		Produce external definitions for global variables and 
		procedures in the package.
	$get_default_proc(Idx,Pred,Arity)
		Get the default procedure whose index in the default procedure
		table is given.
	$get_default_use(Idx,ModuleName)
		Get the default use module whose index in the default use
		module table is given.
	$current_package(Pckg)
		Get the name of the current package already loaded.


nopckg.c
	Represents an empty package. The object file of this file
	is linked with ALS-Prolog library to get ALS-Prolog system in 386
	systems.


pckg.h
	Include file for the packaging system.


pckgproc.h
	List of procedures with their names. These procedures can appear
	in code produced by the compiler. This file is included by
	the file "pckgdis.c".
	NOTE: 	If a new builtin is added or deleted from the system
		this file should also be updated to reflect that change.


pckgsys.h
	This file contains system dependent macros for the packaging
	system. There are three sets of macros in this file for 
	PharLap Assembler, MicroPort Assembler, and Xenix Assembler.

pckg.pro
	Contains predicates to create packages. 
	Predicates in this file are system independent. 
	But there are also three system dependent files. Each of these file
	is used with one of four versions of 386 systems.
		pdos.pro   	for 	MS-DOS version
		pmport.pro 	for 	MicroPort SystemV version
		pxenix.pro	for	Xenix version
		psunos.pro	for	SunOS version
