Get Host ID PSL
===============

Chuck Houpt, 9-Sept-99

The gethostid.psl is an extension that allows prolog to determine the
host id (often a unique hardware serial number) on Unix systems.  The
current version has been built and tested on Linux, Solaris, and HP-UX.
The gethostid.psl provides gethostid/1:

gethostid(?id)

Unifies id with the host id number.
