ALS ObjectPro is an object-oriented programming toolkit fully integrated with
ALS Prolog. Unlike some other approaches to object-oriented programming in
Prolog, it is not implemented as a system on top of Prolog. Instead, it is seamlessly
integrated with Prolog: object-oriented facilities can be smoothly accessed from ordinary Prolog programs, and the full power of Prolog can be used in the definition
of object methods.
