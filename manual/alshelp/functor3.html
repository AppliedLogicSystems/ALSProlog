functor/3 &mdash; builds structures and retrieves information about them

<P ></P >
<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >The principal functor of term Structure has name Functor and arity Arity , where Functor is an atom. Either Structure must be instantiated to a term or an atom , or Functor and Arity must be instantiated to an atom and a non-negative integer respectively. 
<P ></P >
In the case where Structure is initially unbound , functor/3 will unify Structure with a structured term of Arity arguments , where the principal functor of the term is Functor. Each argument of the new structure will be a new uninstantiated variable. 
<P ></P >
When Structure is instantiated to a structured term , Functor will be unified with the principal functor of Structure and Arity will be unified with the arity. functor/3 treats atoms as structured terms with arity 0 The principal functor of a 
list is ‘.’ with arity 2
