<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >If the stream associated with Stream_or_alias supports repositioning, Current_position is unified with the current stream position of the stream, and, as a 
side effect, the stream position of this stream is set to the position 
represented by New_position. New_position may be one of the following values 
<P ></P >
<IMG SRC = images/Bullet.gif ALT = images/Bullet.gif BORDER = 0 WIDTH = 3 HEIGHT = 7 >An absolute integer which represents the address of a character in the stream. 
The beginning of the stream or the first character in the stream has position 
0 The second character in the stream has position 1 and so on. 
<P ></P >
<IMG SRC = images/Bullet.gif ALT = images/Bullet.gif BORDER = 0 WIDTH = 3 HEIGHT = 7 >The atom beginning_of_stream. 
<P ></P >
<IMG SRC = images/Bullet.gif ALT = images/Bullet.gif BORDER = 0 WIDTH = 3 HEIGHT = 7 >The term beginning_of_stream ( N ) where N is an integer greater than zero. The position represented by this term is 
the beginning of the stream plus N bytes. 
<P ></P >
<IMG SRC = images/Bullet.gif ALT = images/Bullet.gif BORDER = 0 WIDTH = 3 HEIGHT = 7 >The atom end_of_stream. 
<P ></P >
<IMG SRC = images/Bullet.gif ALT = images/Bullet.gif BORDER = 0 WIDTH = 3 HEIGHT = 7 >The term end_of_stream ( N ) where N is an integer less than or equal to zero. This allows positions ( earlier 
than the end of stream ) to be specified relative to the end of the stream. The 
position represented by this term is the end-of-stream position plus N bytes. 
<P ></P >
<IMG SRC = images/Bullet.gif ALT = images/Bullet.gif BORDER = 0 WIDTH = 3 HEIGHT = 7 >The atom current_position. 
<P ></P >
<IMG SRC = images/Bullet.gif ALT = images/Bullet.gif BORDER = 0 WIDTH = 3 HEIGHT = 7 >The term current_position ( N ) where N is an integer. This allows positions to be specified relative to the current 
position in the file.
