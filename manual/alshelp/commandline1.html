<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >When ALS Prolog is started from an operating system shell, the command line 
can be divided into system-specific and application-specific portions by use of 
the -p or -P ( for Prolog ) switch. All command line parameters to the left of the -p switch are treated as ALS Prolog system switches,, while those to the right 
of the -p switch are treated as application switches. 
<P ></P >
To make the latter available to Prolog applications, when ALS Prolog is 
initialized, a list SWITCHES of atoms and UIAs representing the items to the right of the -p switch is created, and 
<P ></P >
command_line ( SWITCHES ) 
<P ></P >
is asserted in module builtins. This assertion is always made, even when -p is not used, in which case the argument of command_line/1 is the empty list. 
<P ></P >
The -P switch will force the name of the invoking program to be the argument 
( usually alspro ) .. the switch is useful for developing applications which will eventually be 
packaged ( via save_image/2 ) . Packaged applications will place the entire command line into command_line/1. In particular, the first element in the list obtained from command_line/1 in a packaged application will be the name of the application.
