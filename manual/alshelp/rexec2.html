<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >rexec/2 is an interface to the rexec system call which may be used to run commands on 
remote machines. When remote execution is not desired , fork and exec ( Unix system calls ) are used to run the command on the local machine. 
Command should be an atom representing the command to run. Options is a list 
containing zero or more of the following forms 
<P ></P >
host ( HostName ) – execute the command on the machine named by HostName. 
<P ></P >
username ( User ) – run the command as user User. 
<P ></P >
password ( Password ) – provides the password for authentication purposes. If no password is 
supplied , you will be prompted for one ( by the rexec daemon ) . 
<P ></P >
rstream ( Stream , OpenOpts ) – designates the input stream to read the output of the command from. This 
stream will be connected to the standard output of the command. Stream will be bound to a stream descriptor. OpenOpts is a list containing options suitable for a call to open/4. 
<P ></P >
wstream ( Stream , OpenOpts ) – designates the output stream to write to. This output stream will be 
connected to standard input of the command. 
<P ></P >
estream ( Stream , OpenOpts ) – designates the input stream for use in obtaining error messages from the 
command. This stream will be connected to standard error for the command. 
<P ></P >
If any of host , username , or password are specified , rexec/2 will attempt to contact the rexec daemon to remotely run the command on the specified machine. The remote 
execution daemon , rexecd , requires authentication. This means that either a username and password 
must be supplied in the program ( with the username/1 and password/1 forms ) , interactively , or via the .netrc file. Not all remote execution daemons support authentication via the .netrc file. See your local system documentation for information about the .netrc file. 
<P ></P >
If none of host , username , or password are specified , then rexec/2 will use the traditional fork and exec mechanism to run the command on the local machine. If remote execution is 
still desired , but the rexec daemon's authentication mechanisms deemed too odious , then rsh ( running on the local machine ) may be used to run a command on a remote 
machine.

<B >EXAMPLES 
<P ></P >
</B >The following procedure will call the unix word count program , wc , to determine the length of an atom. 
<P ></P >
slow_atom_length ( A , Len ) : 
<P ></P >
rexec ( ' wc -c' 
<P ></P >
[rstream ( RS , [] ) , wstream ( WS , [] ) ] ) , 
<P ></P >
write ( WS , A ) , 
<P ></P >
close ( WS ) , 
<P ></P >
read_term ( RS , Len , [attach_fullstop ( true ) ] ) , 
<P ></P >
close ( RS ) . 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
? - slow_atom_length ( ' The rain in Spain' , Len ) . 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
Len = 17 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
yes. 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
The version of slow_atom_length/2 above assumes one is running on a Unix machine and calls wc running on the 
same machine. The version below , slow_atom_length/3 , will work on any system which supports sockets ( Unix workstations , Windows 
95 with WinSock , Macintosh ) : 
<P ></P >
rstrlen ( Host , A , Len ) : 
<P ></P >
rexec ( ‘wc -c’ 
<P ></P >
[host ( Host ) , rstream ( RS , [] ) , 
<P ></P >
wstream ( WS , [] ) ] ) , 
<P ></P >
write ( WS , A ) , 
<P ></P >
close ( WS ) , 
<P ></P >
read_term ( RS , Len , [attach_fullstop ( true ) ] ) , 
<P ></P >
close ( RS ) . 
<P ></P >
Here is an interaction running over the internet 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
? - rstrlen ( ‘bongo.cs.anywhere.edu’ , ’abcdef’ , X ) . 
<P ></P >
Name ( bongo.cs.anywhere.edu : ken ) : mylogin 
<P ></P >
Password ( bongo.cs.anywhere.edu : ken ) : &lt; ypasswd&gt; 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
X = 6 
<P ></P >

<B >NOTES 
<P ></P >
</B >This function is not yet very consistent with regards to error handling. Some 
errors will be thrown , while others will print a diagnostic. Other errors 
will cause failure. This functionality will be cleaned up in a later release.
