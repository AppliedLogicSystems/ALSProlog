<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >Key may be an atom or a compound term , but in the latter case , only its functor 
is significant. Both predicates will fail in all other cases of Key. recorda ( Key , Term , Ref ) enters Term into the internal term database at the first item associated with Key , and returns a database reference Ref. recordz ( Key , Term , Ref ) enters Term as the last item associated with Key. 
<P ></P >
recorded ( Key , Term , Ref ) searches the internal term database for an item Term associated with Key such that the associated database reference unifies with Ref.
