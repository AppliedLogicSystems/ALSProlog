<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >spy/1 places a spy point on the procedure name Name/Arity. nospy/1 removes a specific spy point, while nospy/0 removes all spy points that are currently set. During consult or reconsult 
all spy points are disabled, and spy points on predicates which are consulted or 
reconsulted are removed. spy/0 re-enables spy points which have been disabled ( e.g., those which were not 
removed, but were disabled during a reconsult ) .
