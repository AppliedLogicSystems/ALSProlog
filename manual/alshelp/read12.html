<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >These predicates are used to read a term from a stream using the operator 
declarations in effect at the time of the read. The end of the term read from the 
stream is indicated by a fullstop token appearing in the stream. The fullstop 
token is a period ( ' .' ) followed by a newline , white space character , or line comment character. 
If the stream is positioned so that there are no more terms to be read and the 
stream has the property eof_action ( eof_code ) , then Term will be unified with the atom end_of_file. 
<P ></P >
read/1 reads a term from the current input stream and unifies it with Term. 
<P ></P >
read/2 reads a term from the input stream specified by Stream_or_Alias and unifies it with Term. 
<P ></P >
read_term/2 reads a term from the current input stream with options Options ( see below ) and unifies the term read with Term. 
<P ></P >
read_term/3 reads a term from the input stream specified by Stream_or_Alias and unifies it with Term. The options specified by Options are used in the process of reading the term. 
<P ></P >
read_term/2 and read_term/3 take the parameter Options which is a list of options to read_term. These options either affect the behavior of read_term or are used to retrieve additional information about the term which was read. 
<P ></P >
The following options supported by ALS Prolog are options specified by the 
March ' 93 ISO Prolog Standard.. 
<P ></P >
<UL ><LI >ariables ( Vars ) – After reading a term , Vars shall be a list of the variables in the term read , in left-to-right traversal 
order. 
<P ></P >
<LI >ariable_names ( VN_list ) – After reading a term , VN_list will be unified with a list of elements of the form V = A where V is a variable in the term and A is an atom representing the name of the variable. Anonymous variables 
( variables whose name is ' _' ) will not appear in this list. 
<P ></P >
</UL >singletons ( VN_list ) – After reading a term , VN_list will be unified with a list of elements of the form V = A , where V is a variable occurring in the term only once and A is an atom which represents the name of the variable. Anonymous variables 
will not appear in this list. 
<P ></P >
The following option does not conform to the standard , but is supported by 
ALS Prolog. 
<P ></P >
attach_fullstop ( Bool ) – Bool is either true or false. The default is false. When Bool is true , a fullstop is inserted before the end of the stream. This option is most 
useful for reading single terms from atom , character , and character code streams.

<B >NOTES 
<P ></P >
</B >The ISO Prolog Standard requires that an error be thrown when there is a 
syntax error in a stream being read. The default action at the present time for ALS 
Prolog is to print out an error message describing the syntax error and then 
attempt to read another term. This action is consistent with the behavior of 
older DEC-10 compatible Prologs. It is expected that ALS Prolog will eventually 
comply with the standard in this respect.
