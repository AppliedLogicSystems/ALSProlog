Choosing Consult produces two different behaviors , depending on whether the Prolog menu was 
pulled down from the main listener or debugger windows , or from an editor window. 
Using the accelerator key sequence ( <I >Ctrl-K </I >on Unix and Windows , and <I >&lt; ppleKey&gt;K </I >on Macintosh ) produces equivalent behaviors in the different settings. If Consult is chosen from the main listener or debugger windows , a file selection dialog 
appears , and the selected file is ( re ) consulted into the current Prolog database. In contrast , if Consult is selected from an edit window ( or the <I >Ctrl/&lt;apple&gt;-K </I >accellerator key is hit over that window ) , the file associated with that 
window is ( re ) consulted into the Prolog database; if unsaved changes have been 
made in the editor window , the file/window is first Saved before consulting. 
<P ></P >
If a file containing syntax errors is consulted , these errors are collected 
an editor window into the file is opened , and the errors are displayed , as 
indicated below 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
Line numbers are added on the left , and the lines on which errors occur are 
marked in red. Lines in which an error occurs at a specified point are marked in 
a combination of red and green , with the change in color indicating the point 
at which the error occurs. Erroneous lines without such a specific error 
point , such as attempts to redefine comma , are marked all in red. A scrollable pane 
is opened below the edit window , and all the errors that occurred are listed 
in that pane. Double clicking on one the listed errors in the lower pane will 
cause the upper window to scroll until the corresponding error line appears in 
the upper pane. The upper pane is an ordinary error window , and the errors can 
be corrected and the file saved. Choosing Prolog&gt; Consult , or typing ^K will cause the file to be reconsulted , and the error panes to be closed. 
<P ></P >
Clear Workspace causes all procedures which have been consulted to be abolished , , including 
clauses which have been dynamically asserted. In addition , future releases 
all user-defined Tc/Tkl interpreters will also be destroyed.

The four Project-related buttons as well as the bottom entry on this menu are described in the 
next section.

Set Directory ... allows you to change the current working directory.

Selecting IDE Settings raises the following dialog

The Heartbeat is the time interval between moments when a Prolog program temporarily yields 
control to the Tcl/Tk interface to allow for processing of GUI events 
including clicks on the Interrupt button. 
<P ></P >
The Print depth setting contols how deep printing of nested terms will proceed; when the 
depth limit is reached , some representation ( normally ‘ * ’ or ‘...’ ) is printed 
instead of continuing with the nested term. 
<P ></P >
The Printing depth type setting determines whether traversing a list or the top-level arguments of a 
term increases the print depth counter. The Flat setting indicates that the counter will not increase as one traverses a list 
or the top level of a term , while Non-flat specifies that the counter will increase. 
<P ></P >
Selecting Dynamic Flags produces a popup window which displays the current values of all of the 
changable Prolog flags in the system , and allows one to reset any of those 
values. 
<P ></P >
Selecting Static Flags producs a popup window displaying the values of all of the unchangable Prolog 
flags for the system
