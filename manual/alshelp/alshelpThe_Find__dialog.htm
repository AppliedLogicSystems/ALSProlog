<A NAME="f55d1b83"></A>This dialog allows one to search in whatever window is top-most, and to carry
out replacements in editor windows.  If the text which has been typed into the Search for: box is located, the window containing it is adjusted so that the sought-for
text is approximately centered vertically, and the text is highlighted.
