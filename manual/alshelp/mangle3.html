mangle/3 &mdash; destructively modify a structure

<B>FORMS</B>

<P ></P >
<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >mangle/3 destructively modifies an argument of a compound term in a spirit 
similar to Lisp’s rplaca and rplacd. Structure must be instantiated to a compound term with at least N arguments. The Nth argument of Structure will become NewArg. Lists are considered to be structures of arity two. 
<P ></P >
Modifications made to a structure by mangle/3 will survive failure and backtracking. 
<P ></P >
Even though mangle/3 implements destructive assignment in Prolog, it is not necessarily more 
efficient than copying a term. This is due to the extensive cleanup operation which 
ensures that the effects of a mangle/3 persist across failure.
