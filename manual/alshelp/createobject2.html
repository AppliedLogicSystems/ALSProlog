<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >The call 
<P ></P >
create_object ( Eqns , Obj ) 
<P ></P >
creates an object Obj as specified by Eqns , a list of <I >equations </I >of the form 
<P ></P >
Keyword = Value . 
<P ></P >
The acceptable keywords , together with their associated Value types , are 
<P ></P >
instanceOf - atom ( name of a class ) 
<P ></P >
<UL ><LI >alues - list of equations 
<P ></P >
</UL >The instanceOf keyword equation is the only required equation; the value on the right side 
of this equation must be an atom which is the name of class which is visible 
from the module in which the create_object call is made. 
<P ></P >
The equations appearing on the list which is the right side of a 
<P ></P >
<UL ><LI >alues = ValuesList 
<P ></P >
</UL >equation are expressions of the form 
<P ></P >
SlotName = SlotValue 
<P ></P >
where SlotName is one of the named slots in the structure defining the object’s state. 
These slots are determined by the class to which the object belongs , and may be 
slots from the state-schema of the immediate class parent , or may also be slots 
from any of the state-schemata of ancestor classes. Entries in values equations prescribe initial values for some of the object’s slots when it is 
created. 
<P ></P >
When a global atomic name for the object is required , Eqns includes an equation of the form 
<P ></P >
name = &lt; tom&gt; .
