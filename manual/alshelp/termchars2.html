<P ></P >
<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >If CharList is bound to a list of characters then it is parsed according to the syntax 
rules for terms. Should the parse be successful, the resulting value is unified 
with Term in a call to term_chars/2. 
<P ></P >
If CodeList is bound to a list of character codes then it is is parsed according to the 
syntax rules for terms. Should the parse be successful, the resulting value is 
unified with Term in a call to term_codes/2. 
<P ></P >
Otherwise CharList ( or CodeList ) will be bound to the list of characters ( character codes ) which would result 
as output from write_canonical ( Term )
