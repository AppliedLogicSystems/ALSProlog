<P></P>
<B>FORMS</B>
<P ></P >
</B >call ( Goal ) 
<P ></P >
Goal 
<P ></P >
<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >If Goal is instantiated to a structured term or atom which would be acceptable as the 
body of a clause , the goal call ( Goal ) is executed exactly as if that term appeared textually in place of the 
expression call ( Goal ) . 
<P ></P >
<B >EXAMPLES 
<P ></P >
</B >The following example illustrates the use of call/1 : 
<P ></P >
? - [user]. 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
Wrong Way! 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
Goal = write ( ’Wrong Way!’ ) 
<P ></P >
