<P ></P >
</B >poll ( Stream_or_Alias, TimeOut 
<P ></P >
<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >poll/2 will wait at most TimeOut microseconds and then succeed if a non-blocking I/O operation may be started 
on the stream associated with Stream_or_Alias. Failure will occur if the I/O operation would block. 
<P ></P >
<B >ERRORS 
<P ></P >
</B >Stream_or_Alias is a variable 
<P ></P >
––––&gt; instantiation_error. 
<P ></P >
Stream_or_Alias is neither a variable nor a stream descriptor nor an alias 
<P ></P >
––––&gt; domain_error ( stream_or_alias, Stream_or_Alias ) . 
<P ></P >
Stream_or_Alias is not associated with an open stream 
<P ></P >
––––&gt; existence_error ( stream, Stream_or_Alias ) . 
<P ></P >
TimeOut is a variable 
<P ></P >
––––&gt; instantiation_error. 
<P ></P >
TimeOut is not an integer 
<P ></P >
––––&gt; type_error ( integer, TimeOut ) . 
<P ></P >
<B >NOTES 
<P ></P >
</B >Note that an input operation such as read/2 may block anyway if there is insufficient input to syntactically complete the 
term and the terminating full-stop. It is possible for poll to succeed when only the first character of the term is ready. The open/[3, 4] option, snr_action, is better used for situations where reading a term from a stream which might 
not be ready is desirable.
