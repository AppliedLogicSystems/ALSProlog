<P ></P >
<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >flush_input/1 will cause the buffer contents associated with the input stream Stream_or_Alias to be discarded. This will cause the next input operation to read in a new 
buffer from the source attached to Stream. 
<P ></P >
<B >ERRORS 
<P ></P >
</B >Stream_or_Alias is a variable 
<P ></P >
––––&gt; instantiation_error. 
<P ></P >
Stream_or_Alias is neither a variable nor a stream descriptor nor an alias 
<P ></P >
––––&gt; domain_error ( stream_or_alias, Stream_or_Alias ) 
<P ></P >
Stream_or_Alias is not an input stream 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
<B >NOTES 
<P ></P >
</B >This operation is useful on streams which have an associated output stream on 
which prompts are being written to. Flushing the input and then performing the 
requisite input operation will cause a prompt to be written out prior to 
reading input. 
<P ></P >
This operation is also useful for use with datagram sockets. The buffer 
contents associated with a datagram socket represent the entire datagram. When the 
end of the datagram is reached, an end-of-file condition will be triggered so 
that the program reading the datagram will not inadvertently read beyond the 
datagram into the next datagram ( if any ) . flush_input/1 should be used to reset the end-of-file indication after the datagram has 
been processed.
