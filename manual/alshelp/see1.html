<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >see/1 sets the current input stream to the file named File. If File is already open for input , the existing file descriptor will be used. 
Otherwise , a new file descriptor will be allocated , and input operations will start at 
the beginning of the file. 
<P ></P >
seeing/1 unifies File with the name of the current input stream. If no stream has been explicitly 
opened by see/1 , then file will be unified with the atom user. 
<P ></P >
seen/0 closes the current input stream and deallocates its file descriptor. The 
current input stream is then set to the special file <I >user </I >. <I >user </I >is the name of the default input stream which is normally connected to the 
keyboard. The special file user is always present , and seen/0 can never close it. Although seen/0 can never close the file user , seen/0 will reset the user I/O descriptor as follows. If a read/n has been executed from user , and if an end of file character sequence is 
encountered ( Control-D on Unix or the Mac , or Control-Z on Win32/DOS and on the Mac ) , then the read/n returns end_of_file and a subsequent seen/0 on user will reset the I/O descriptor for user so that the EOF condition is 
no longer present.
