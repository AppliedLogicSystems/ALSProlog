<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >Module should be instantiated to a name of a module and Goal should be instantiated to a non-variable term. The Goal will be executed as if the call to Goal appeared in the module named Module. Any module dependent procedures such as assert/1 or retract/1 will operate on the procedures defined in Module. Any cuts appearing in Goal will cut back through the head of the clause that contained the call to : /2
