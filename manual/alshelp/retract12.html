retract/1 &mdash; removes a clause from the database

retract/2 &mdash; removes a clause specified by a database reference

erase/1 &mdash; removes a clause from the database

<B>FORMS</B>
<P ></P >
</B >retract ( Clause ) 
<P ></P >
retract ( Clause, DBRef ) 
<P ></P >
erase ( DBRef ) 
<P ></P >
<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >When Clause is bound to an atom or a structured term, the current module is searched for 
a clause that will unify with Clause. When a matching clause is found in the database, Clause is unified with the structure corresponding to the clause. The clause is then 
removed from the database. 
<P ></P >
retract/2 additionally unifies DBRef with the database reference of the clause. 
<P ></P >
erase/1 removes the clause associated with DBRef from the database. Note that erase ( DBRef ) should never be called following retract ( Clause, DBRef ) since at that point DBRef is no longer a valid database reference. 
<P ></P >
retract/1 and retract/2 will repeatedly generate and remove clauses upon backtracking. : /2 can be used to specify which module should be searched. 
<P ></P >
<B >EXAMPLES 
<P ></P >
</B >The following example shows how retract/1 and retract/2 can be used to get rid of all the comic book heroes that live in our modules. 
First we create all the heroes by consulting user. Then we get rid of hero ( spiderman ) by using a simple call to retract/1 
<P ></P >
? - [user]. 
<P ></P >
Consulting user. 
<P ></P >
hero ( spiderman ) . 
<P ></P >
hero ( superman ) . 
<P ></P >
hero ( batman ) . 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
module girls. 
<P ></P >
hero ( superwoman ) . 
<P ></P >
endmod. 
<P ></P >
^D user consulted. 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
yes. 
<P ></P >
? - retract ( hero ( spiderman ) ) . 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
yes. 
<P ></P >
In the next example, we show what heroes are left by using the listing/1 procedure. After that, we remove hero ( superman ) with a retract/2 call. The old database reference to the man of steel is instantiated to Ref. 
<P ></P >
? - listing ( hero/1 ) . 
<P ></P >
% user : hero/1 
<P ></P >
hero ( superman ) . 
<P ></P >
hero ( batman ) . 
<P ></P >
% girls : hero/1 
<P ></P >
hero ( superwoman ) . 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
yes. 
<P ></P >
? - retract ( hero ( superman ), Ref ) . 
<P ></P >
Ref = ’$dbref’ ( 5208, 15, 2384, 1 ) 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
yes. 
<P ></P >
In this next example, we use clause/3 to find the database reference of hero ( batman ) . After this, we use the database reference in a retract/2 call to remove hero ( batman ) from the database. Note that the Clause argument for retract/2 is uninstantiated in this call. The clause that was removed is instantiated 
to Clause, after the call to retract/2 has succeeded. 
<P ></P >
? - clause ( hero ( batman ), Body, Ref ) . 
<P ></P >
Body = true 
<P ></P >
Ref = ’$dbref’ ( 5052, 15, 2384, 2 ) 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
yes. 
<P ></P >
? - retract ( Clause, ’$dbref’ ( 5052, 15, 2384, 2 ) ) . 
<P ></P >
Clause = hero ( batman ) 
<P ></P >
yes. 
<P ></P >
In the following example, we list the heroes left in the database. Only hero ( superwoman ) is left, but she’s in a different module. However, using the Mod : Goal construct, we can remove her too 
<P ></P >
? - listing ( hero/1 ) . 
<P ></P >
% girls : hero/1 
<P ></P >
hero ( superwoman ) . 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
yes. 
<P ></P >
? - girls : retract ( hero ( X ) ) . 
<P ></P >
X = superwoman 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
yes. 
<P ></P >
? - listing ( hero/1 ) . 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
yes. 
<P ></P >
As the last call to listing/1 shows, there are no more heroes left in the database. ( Who knows what evil 
may be lurking in the garbage collector though! )
