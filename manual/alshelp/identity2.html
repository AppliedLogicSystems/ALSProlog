<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >Term1 is identical to Term2 ( Term1 = = Term2 ) if they can be unified, and variables occupying equivalent positions in both 
terms are identical. For atoms and variables, this is an absolute identity 
check. Viewing Prolog terms as trees in memory, = = /2 determines whether Term1 and Term2 are isomorphic trees whose leaves are identical. Unlike = /2, no variables are bound inside a call to = = /2 \ = = fails when = = succeeds, and conversely.
