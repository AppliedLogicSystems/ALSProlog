If Pred is the name of a predicate, listing ( Pred ) causes all the clauses for Pred of any arity and residing in any module other than builtins to be listed to the current output stream. The argument Pred may be a predicate specification of the form Name/Arity in which case only the clauses for the specified predicate are listed. If P is the name of predicate of arity A which is defined in module M, then 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
? - listing ( M : P/A ) . 
<P ></P >
will cause only the clauses of the definition of P/A in M to be listed to the current output stream. A form of wildcards can be used 
if some of the arguments are left as uninstantiated variables. The following 
example lists all the eggs clauses in module dairy regardless of what their arity is 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
? - listing ( dairy : eggs/_ ) .
