<P ></P >

[-File | Files] 
<P ></P >
<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >FileSpec should be instantiated either to an atom that is the name of a file , or to a 
list of atoms which are names of files. For each File occurring on FileSpec , File is opened and read , any clauses currently in memory which were read and 
asserted previously from this same File are erased , and the clauses occurring in File are asserted into the database , and the directives occurring in File are executed immediately when it is encountered. 
<P ></P >
consultq/1 behaves exactly like consult/1 , except that printing of normal messages on the terminal is suppressed. 
[Note , however , that if the File does not exist , an error message will still be printed.] 
<P ></P >
reconsult/1 is identical to consult/1 except in the file in question makes it possible to amend a program without 
having to restart from scratch and consult all the files which make up the 
program. Both are included for historical reasons , but the former behavior of consult/1 ( asserting clauses read with no erasures ) can only be obtained by using 
options in consult/2. 
<P ></P >
consult/1 , reconsult/1 , and consultq/1 are defined by 
<P ></P >
consult ( File ) : - consult ( File , [] ) . 
<P ></P >
reconsult ( File : - consult ( File , [] ) . 
<P ></P >
consultq ( File ) : - consult ( File , 
<P ></P >
[verbosity ( quiet ) ] ) . 
<P ></P >
If File is the atom user , then clauses and commands will be read in from the keyboard until an end of 
file is read. 
<P ></P >
The Options argument of consult/2 is a list of <I >consult options , </I >and their effects , are as follows 
<P ></P >
<UL ><LI >erbosity ( Value ) 
<P ></P >
</UL >Value = quiet/noisy; turns on/off the printing of messages during consulting. 
<P ></P >
tgtmod ( TgtMod ) 
<P ></P >
Any clauses in File which are not explicitly enclosed in module begin/end directives will be 
asserted to module TgtMod. The default value of TgtMod is user. 
<P ></P >
search_path ( DirPathList ) 
<P ></P >
DirPathList is a list of directory path names. The File ( s ) to be consulted are searched for on this path. If the current directory 
is not listed on DirPathList , it is added at the beginning. 
<P ></P >
strict_search_path ( DirPathList ) 
<P ></P >
Like search_path ( DirPathList ) , but the current directory is not added even if not present on DirPathList. 
<P ></P >
consult ( Value ) 
<P ></P >
Value = true /false. If Value = true , previous clauses from the File being consulted are <I >not </I >erased , so that the net effect is additive. 
<P ></P >
ensure_loaded ( Value ) 
<P ></P >
Value = true /false. This option has effect only when operating under one of the ALS development 
shells ( the ALS IDE , or the old TTY shell ) . If Value = true , and if File has previously been consulted , no action is taken for File. If Value = false , File is consulted. 
<P ></P >
<B >EXAMPLES 
<P ></P >
</B >The following example illustrates the practice of putting calls to consult/1 inside of files to be ( re ) consulted. We have the three files with contents 
as follows 
<P ></P >
letters.pro 
<P ></P >
symbol ( a ) . 
<P ></P >
symbol ( b ) . 
<P ></P >
symbol ( c ) . 
<P ></P >
numbers.pro 
<P ></P >
symbol ( ' 1' ) . 
<P ></P >
symbol ( ' 2' ) . 
<P ></P >
symbol ( ' 3' ) . 
<P ></P >
topfile.pro 
<P ></P >
symbol ( x ) . 
<P ></P >
symbol ( y ) . 
<P ></P >
symbol ( z ) . 
<P ></P >
: - consult ( letters ) . 
<P ></P >
: - consult ( numbers ) . 
<P ></P >

<B >NOTES 
<P ></P >
</B >reconsult/1 is not compatible with the DEC-10 notion of reconsult. DEC-10 reconsult would , upon seeing a procedure not already seen in a file 
wipe out or abolish all clauses for that predicate before adding the new 
clause in question. 
<P ></P >
The present semantics of reconsult/1 are that all clauses which were previously defined in a file are wiped out 
with new clauses replacing ( positionally in the procedure ) any old clauses. 
Thus , a procedure that is defined by several files will not be entirely wiped out 
when reconsult/1 is invoked on just one of the files – only those clauses defined by the one 
file are wiped out and subsequently replaced. 
<P ></P >
The file <I >user </I >is special. When <I >user </I >is consulted or reconsulted , the input clauses will be taken from the user’s 
terminal. The end-of-file character ( often Control-D or Contol-Z ) should be 
used to terminate the consultation and return to the shell.
