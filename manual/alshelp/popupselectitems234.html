<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >

items. The shorter versions are defined by 
<P ></P >
popup_select_items ( SourceList, ChoiceList 
<P ></P >
: -

<P ></P >
For the general call 
<P ></P >
popup_select_items ( Interp, SourceList, Options 
<P ></P >
ChoiceList 
<P ></P >
Interp should be an atom naming a Tcl interpreter, SourceList should be a list of atoms, ChoiceList should be an uninstantiated variable, and Options should be a list of equations of the forms 
<P ></P >
mode = SelectMode 
<P ></P >
title = Atom 
<P ></P >
where SelectMode is one of 
<P ></P >
browse single multiple extended 
<P ></P >
If the selection mode is <I >single </I >or <I >brow se </I >, at most one element can be selected in the listbox at once. In both of 
these modes, clicking button 1 on an element selects it and deselects any other 
selected item. In <I >browse </I >mode it is also possible to drag the selection with button 1 
<P ></P >
If the selection mode is <I >multipl e </I >or <I >exten ded </I >, any number of elements may be selected at once, including discontiguous 
ranges. In <I >multiple </I >mode, clicking button 1 on an element toggles its selection state without 
affecting any other elements. In <I >extended </I >mode, pressing button 1 on an element selects it, deselects everything 
else, and sets the anchor to the element under the mouse; dragging the mouse 
with button 1 down extends the selection to include all the ele ments 
between the anchor and the element under the mouse, inclusive.

<B >EXAMPLES 
<P ></P >
</B >The call 
<P ></P >
? - popup_select_items 
<P ></P >
[‘The first item’, ’Item #2’, 
<P ></P >
‘Item three’, the_final_item] 
<P ></P >
Selection ) . 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
produces the popup shown below. 
<P ></P >
<IMG SRC = images/popup_list_select-1.gif ALT = images/popup_list_select-1.gif BORDER = 0 WIDTH = 204 HEIGHT = 414 >
<P ></P >
In this case, the user is allowed to select a single item; if the user 
selected “Item three” and clicked OK, the result would be 
<P ></P >
Selection = [Item three]. 
<P ></P >
Even though in this case the user was restricted to selection of one item, the 
<P ></P >
popup_select_items/_ predicate returns a list of the selected items. The Options argument for popup_select_items/[3, 4] allows the programmer to place the 
popup list box in any of the other standard Tk listbox selection modes. For 
example, the call 
<P ></P >
? - popup_select_items ( 
<P ></P >
[‘The first item’, ’Item #2’, 
<P ></P >
‘Item three’, the_final_item] 
<P ></P >
[mode = extended, title = ’Extended Mode Selection’] 
<P ></P >
Selection ) . 
<P ></P >

<P ></P >
will popup a list box whose appearance is identical ( apart from the different 
title requested ) to the previous listbox. However, it will permit selection 
of ranges of elements, as seen below 
<P ></P >
<IMG SRC = images/popup_list_choice-2.gif ALT = images/popup_list_choice-2.gif BORDER = 0 WIDTH = 196 HEIGHT = 410 >
<P ></P >
The result of clicking OK will be 
<P ></P >
Selection = [Item #2, Item three] 
<P ></P >
