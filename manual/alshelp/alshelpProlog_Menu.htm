<A NAME="100fefc2"></A>Choosing <A NAME="f55cf816"></A>Consult produces two different behaviors, depending on whether the Prolog menu was
pulled down from the main listener or debugger windows, or from an editor window.
 Using the accelerator key sequence (<I>Ctrl-K</I> on Unix and Windows,  and <I>&lt;AppleKey&gt;K  </I>on Macintosh) produces equivalent behaviors in the different settings.   If Consult is chosen from the main listener or debugger windows, a file selection dialog
appears, and the selected file is (re)consulted into the current <A NAME="f55cf80d"></A>Prolog <A NAME="f5609bf1"></A><A NAME="f5609bf1"></A>database. In contrast, if Consult is selected from an edit window (or the <I>Ctrl/&lt;apple&gt;-K</I> accellerator key is hit over that window),  the file associated with that
window is (re)consulted into the Prolog database; if unsaved changes have been
made in the editor window, the file/window is first Saved before consulting.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f55e1fb6"></A>If a file containing syntax errors is consulted, these errors are collected,
an editor window into the file is opened, and the errors are displayed, as
indicated below:

<P></P>
<A NAME="f55d233c"></A>Line numbers are added on the left, and the lines on which errors occur are
marked in red.  Lines in which an error occurs at a specified point are marked in
a combination of red and green, with the change in color indicating the point
at which the error occurs.  Erroneous lines without such a specific error
point, such as attempts to redefine comma, are marked all in red.  A scrollable pane
is opened below the edit window, and all the errors that occurred are listed
in that pane.  Double clicking on one the listed errors in the lower pane will
cause the upper window to scroll until the corresponding error line appears in
the upper pane.  The upper pane is an ordinary error window, and the errors can
be corrected and the file saved.  Choosing Prolog&gt; Consult, or typing ^K will cause the file to be reconsulted, and the error panes to be closed.

<A NAME="f55cf80e"></A><A NAME="f567e9a1"></A>Clear <A NAME="f55cf80f"></A><A NAME="f55cf80f"></A>Workspace causes all procedures which have been consulted to be abolished, , including
clauses which have been dynamically asserted.  In addition, future releases,
all user-defined Tc/Tkl interpreters will also be destroyed.

<A NAME="f55d2312"></A>The four <A NAME="f55e60b5"></A>Project-related buttons as well as the bottom entry on this menu are described in the
next section.

<A NAME="f567e238"></A><A NAME="f55cf810"></A>Set <A NAME="f55cf811"></A><A NAME="f55cf811"></A>Directory ... allows you to change the current working directory.

<A NAME="f55f8fe4"></A>Selecting <A NAME="f55e60b4"></A>IDE <A NAME="f5609bf8"></A><A NAME="f5609bf8"></A>Settings raises the following dialog:

<P></P>
<A NAME="f55d2365"></A>The <A NAME="f55e60af"></A>Heartbeat is the time interval between moments when a Prolog program temporarily yields
control to the Tcl/Tk interface to allow for processing of GUI events,
including clicks on the Interrupt button.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f55d2366"></A>The <A NAME="f55e60b0"></A>Print <A NAME="f5609c25"></A><A NAME="f5609c25"></A>depth setting contols how deep printing of nested terms will proceed; when the
depth limit is reached, some representation (normally ‘*’ or ‘...’) is printed
instead of continuing with the nested term.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f55d2367"></A>The <A NAME="f55e60b1"></A>Printing <A NAME="f5609c1d"></A><A NAME="f5609c1d"></A>depth type setting determines whether traversing a list or the top-level arguments of a
term increases the print depth counter.  The <A NAME="f55e60b2"></A>Flat setting indicates that the counter will not increase as one traverses a list
or the top level of a term, while <A NAME="f55e60b3"></A>Non-flat specifies that the counter will increase.
<P></P>
<A NAME="f55d23c1"></A>Selecting <A NAME="f55d23bf"></A>Dynamic <A NAME="f55d23c0"></A><A NAME="f55d23c0"></A>Flags produces a popup window which displays the current values of all of the
changable Prolog flags in the system, and allows one to reset any of those
values.

<A NAME="f55f9008"></A>Selecting <A NAME="f55cf813"></A>Static <A NAME="f55cf814"></A><A NAME="f55cf814"></A>Flags producs a popup window displaying the values of all of the unchangable Prolog
flags for the system
