<P ></P >
<B >DESCRIPTION 
<P ></P >
</B >A message is sent to an object with a call of the form 
<P ></P >
send ( Object , Message ) 
<P ></P >
where Object is the target object ( or an atom naming the object ) , and Message is an arbitrary Prolog term. The Message may include uninstantiated variables which might be instantiated by the 
object’s method for dealing with Message. Such calls to send/2 can occur both in ordinary Prolog code , and in the code defining methods of 
classes. For convience , the call 
<P ></P >
s end_self ( Object , Message ) 
<P ></P >
is provided as syntactic sugar for 
<P ></P >
send ( Object , Message ) 
<P ></P >
No attempt to verify that a send_self message is being sent from an object to itself.
