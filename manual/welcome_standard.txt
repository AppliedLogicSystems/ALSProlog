MANUAL
======
The original (1990's) User Manual for ALS Prolog is provided by the pdf file

	als-prolog-manual.pdf

in this folder, and the original Reference Manual is provided by the pdf file

	als-ref-manual.pdf.

Both manuals can be read using standard PDF viewers, or even by opening them with widely used browsers.

There are separate (original) manuals for the foreign C-language interface, in

	ALS_Prolog_Foreign_SDK/documentation/FI_Manual.pdf  

and

	ALS_Prolog_Foreign_SDK/documentation/FI_Ref.pdf  

HELP SYSTEM
===========

The current Reference Manual for ALS Prolog is implemented as an HTML-based HELP system.
You will need a fairly recent version of a standard browser to read the help files.

After installation is complete, the ALS Prolog HELP system consists of the files

	als_help.html,  alshelp.css,  package_nav.html, 

together with all files in the subfolder alshelp.
	

To view the ALS Prolog Help system, simply open the file

	als_help.html

in your browser.
