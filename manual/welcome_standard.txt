MANUAL
======
The User Manual for ALS Prolog is provided by the file

	als-prolog-manual.pdf

in this folder.  This is an Adobe Acrobat(r) file.  

To read the ALS Prolog manual:  
Double-click on the icon for als-prolog-manual.pdf, or start Acrobat, and load the manual.

There is a separate manual for the foreign C-language interface, in

	ALS_Prolog_Foreign_SDK/documentation/FI_Manual.pdf  

The reference manual is contained in  

	ALS_Prolog_Foreign_SDK/documentation/FI_Ref.pdf  

HELP SYSTEM
===========

The Reference Manual for ALS Prolog is implemented as an HTML-based HELP system.
You will need a fairly recent version of a standard browser to read the help files.

After the installation is complete, the ALS Prolog HELP system is contained in the

	help

directory inside the installation directory.  It consists of a large number of
*.htm and *.gif files, together with a number of additonal files.  In addition,
there is one file

	als_help.htm 

in the installation directory.  To view the ALS Prolog Help system, simply open the 
file

	als_help.htm

in your browser.  PLEASE NOTE that the start-up of the help system may be
slow, since the browser must fire up Java and other components.  However,
once the contents for the system have appeared, it performs quite nicely
on most platforms.
