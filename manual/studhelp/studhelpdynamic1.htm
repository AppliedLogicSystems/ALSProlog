<P></P>
<A NAME="44070340"></A></B>dynamic/1 is a procedure intended to be used in directives in source code.  It will
declare a procedure given by the form Pred/Arity or Module:Pred/Arity to be dynamic.  Such a procedure will be considered to be defined even if it
contains no clauses.  Non-dynamic procedures which have no clauses are
considered to be undefined and if called as such will generate a warning or error
(depending on the value of the undefined_predicate flag).  In the future, procedures declared to be dynamic will also be subject
to the so called &quot;logical database&quot; semantics where the database will appear
to be frozen once a procedure is called.  Only calls that occur (temporally)
after the database modification will be affected by that modification.

declare the procedure to be dynamic.
