<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb92ef"></A><B>DESCRIPTION
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb92f0"></A></B>open/3 and open/4 are used to open a file or other entities for input or output.  Calling    open/3 is the same as calling open/4 where Options is the empty list.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb92f1"></A>Once a stream has been opened with open/3 or open/4, read_term/3 or write_term/3 might then be used to read or write terms to the opened stream.  get_char/2 or put_char/2 can be used to read or write characters.  A <B><I>source</I></B> refers to some entity which may be opened as a stream for read access.  Such
streams, once open, are called input streams.  A <B><I>sink</I></B> refers to some entity which may be written to.  Such a stream is called an
output stream.  There are streams which are both sources and sinks; such streams
may be both read from and written to.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb92f2"></A>Name specifies the source/sink to be opened.  Whether Name is a source or a sink will depend on the value of Mode.  Mode may either be read, indicating that Name is a source or write, which indicating that Name is a sink.  If the source/sink specified by Name, Mode, and the options in Options is successfully opened, then Stream will be unified with a stream descriptor which may be used in I/O operations
on the stream.  If the stream could not be successfully opened, then an error
is thrown.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb92f3"></A>If Name is an atom, then the contents of the stream are the contents of the file with
name Name.   Mode may take on additional values for file streams.  The values which Mode may take on for file streams are:
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb92f4"></A>read –  open the file for read access
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb92f5"></A>write –  open the file for write access; truncate or create as necessary
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb92f6"></A>read_write –  both reading and writing are permitted; file is not truncated on open
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb92f7"></A>append –  open file with write access and position at end of stream
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9323"></A>If Name has the form atom(A), then Name represents an atom stream. When opened with Mode equal to read, A must be an atom.  The contents of the stream are simply the characters
comprising the atom A.  When opened for write access, A will be unified with the atom formed from the characters written to the
stream during the time that the stream was open.  The unification is carried out at
the time that the stream is closed.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb931a"></A>If Name has the form code_list(CL) or string(CL), then Name represents a (character) code list stream.  When opened for read access, the
contents of such a stream are the character codes found in the list CL.  When opened for write access, CL will be unified with a list of<B> </B>character codes.  This list is formed from the charcters written to the stream
during the lifetime of the stream.  The unification is carried out when the
stream is closed.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb931b"></A>If Name has the form char_list(CL), then Name represents a character list stream.   The behavior of character list streams
is identical to that of code list streams with the exception that the types of
the objects in the lists are different.  A code list consists of character
codes, whereas a character list consists of a list of characters.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb931c"></A>Name may also take on one of the following forms representing a socket:
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb931d"></A>    socket(unix,PathName)
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb931e"></A>    socket(inet_stream,Host)
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb931f"></A>    socket(inet_stream,Host,Port)
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9320"></A>    socket(inet_dgram,Host,Port)
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9321"></A>    socket(clone,Stream_Or_Alias)
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9322"></A>Regardless of the mode (read or write), the call to open/[3,4] will attempt to open the stream as a server (if appropriate).  Failing that,
it will attempt to open the stream as a client.  If a connection-oriented
socket is opened as a server, then prior to the first buffer read or write, the stream will wait for a client to connect.  If the stream is opened as a
client, the connection (in a connection-oriented socket) is established as part
of the open.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb934e"></A>socket(unix,PathName): Open a unix domain socket.  Addresses in the unix domain are merely path
names which are specified by PathName. Unix domain sockets are somewhat limited in that both the server and client 
process must reside on the same machine.  The stream will be opened as a
server if the name specified by PathName does not currently exist (and the requisite permissions exist to create a
directory entry).  Otherwise, the stream will be opened as a client.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9345"></A>socket(inet_stream,Host):  Open an internet domain stream socket on the host given by Host using port number 1599.  The stream will be opened as a server if Host is set to the name of the host on which the process is running and no other
process has already established a server stream on this port.  Otherwise, the
stream will be opened as a client.  A permission error will be generated if
neither operation can be performed.  The host specification may either be a host
name or an internet address.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9346"></A>socket(inet_stream,Host,Port): Similar to the above, but the Port may specified.  This permits an application to choose its own &quot;well known&quot; 
port number and act as either a server or client.  Alternately, both Host and Port may be variable in which case the system will open a stream at a port of its
choosing.  When variable, Host and Port will be instantiated to values of the current host and the port which was
actually opened.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9347"></A>socket(inet_dgram,Host,Port):  Similar to inet_stream, but a datagram socket is created instead.  A datagram socket is an endpoint
which is not connected.  The datagram socket will be opened as a server socket
if the Host is either variable or bound to the name of the current host and Port is either variable or bound to a port number which is not currently in use. 
Otherwise, a client socket is established which (by default) will write to the
host and port indicated by Host and Port.  A server socket is initially set up to write out to UDP port 9 which will
discard any messages sent.  Datagram sockets will set the end-of-file indication
for each datagram read.  This mechanism permits code written in Prolog to
fully process each incoming datagram without having to worry about running over
into the next datagram.  flush_input/1 should be used to reset the stream attached to the datagram in order for more
input to be read.  Programmers using datagrams should strive to make each
datagram self contained.  If this is a hardship, stream sockets should be used
instead.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9348"></A>socket(clone,Stream_or_Alias): This specification will create a new (prolog) stream descriptor for a socket
from an existing socket stream descriptor.  This gives the programmer the
ability to create more than one buffer which refers to the same socket.  This
cloning mechanism has two uses.  Firstly, sockets are full duplex which means that
they may be both read from and written to.  Yet, the interface which ALS Prolog
provides will only naturally provide read access or write access, not both
simultaneously.  The cloning mechanism accommodates this problem by allowing
separate (prolog) stream descriptors for each mode which refer to the same unix
socket descriptor.  Secondly, server socket streams will only act as a server until
a connection is established.  Once the connection is made, they lose their
&quot;server&quot; property.  An application which wants to service more than one client will
want to clone its &quot;server&quot; descriptor prior to performing any reads to or
writes from the stream.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9349"></A>The behavior and disposition of a stream may be influenced by the Options argument.  Options is a list comprising one or more of the following terms:
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb934a"></A>type(T) –  T may be either text or binary.  This defines whether the stream is a text
stream or a binary stream.  At present, ALS Prolog makes no distinction between
these two types.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb934b"></A>alias(Alias) –  Alias must be an atom.  This option specifies an alias for the stream.  If an alias
is established, the alias may be passed in lieu of the stream descriptor to
predicates requiring a stream handle.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb934c"></A>reposition(R) – R is either true or false.  reposition(true) indicates that the stream must be repositionable.  If it is not, open/3 or open/4 will throw an error.  reposition(false) indicates that the stream is not repositionable and any attempt to reposition
the stream will result in an error.  If neither option is specified, the
stream will be opened as repositionable if possible.  A program can find out if a
stream is repositionable or not by calling stream_property/2.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb934d"></A>eof_action(Action) – Action may be one of error, eof_code, or reset. Action  instantiated to error indicates that an existence error should be triggered when a stream attempts
to read past end-of-file.  The default action is eof_code which will cause an input predicate reading past end-of-file to return a
distinguished value as the output of the predicate (either end_of_file, or -1).  Finally, Action instantiated to reset indicates that the stream should be reset upon end-of-file.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9379"></A>snr_action(Action) – Action may be one of error, snr_code, or wait.  As with eof_action, Action instantiated to error will generate an existence error when an input operation attempts to read
from a stream for which no input is ready.  snr_code will force the input predicate to return a distinguished code when the stream
is not ready.  This code will be either -2 or the atom stream_not_ready.  The default action is wait which will force the input operation to wait until the stream is ready.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9370"></A>buffering(B)  –  B is either byte, line, or block.  This option applies to streams open for output.  If byte buffering is
specified, the stream buffer will be flushed (actually written out) after each
character.  Line buffering is useful for streams which interact with a user; the
buffer is flushed when a newline character is put into the buffer.  Block
buffering is the default; the buffer is not flushed until the block is full or until a
call to flush_output/1 is made.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9371"></A>bufsize(Size) – Size must be a positive integer.  The Size parameter indicates the size of buffer to allocate the associated stream. 
The default size should be adequate for most streams.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9372"></A>prompt_goal(Goal) – Goal is a ground callable term.  This option is used when opening an input stream.
 Goal will be run each time a new buffer is read.   This option is most useful
when used in conjunction with opening an output stream where a prompt should
be written to whenever new input is required from the input stream.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9373"></A>maxdepth(Depth) – Depth is a positive integer.  This option when specified for an output stream sets
the default maximum depth used to write out a term with write_term/3, et. al.  Explicit options to write_term/3 may be used to override this option.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9374"></A>depth_computation(DC) – DC should be either flat or nonflat. This option indicates the default mechanism to be used for write_term to
compute the depth of a term.  flat indicates that all arguments in a list or structured term should be
considered to be at the same depth.  nonflat indicates that each successive element of a structured term or list is at
depth one greater than its predecessor.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9375"></A>line_length(Length) – Length is a positive integer.  This option is used to set the default line length
associated with the stream.  Predicates which deal with term output use this
parameter to break the line at appropriate points when outputting a term which will
span several lines.  Explicit options to write_term/3 may be used to override this option.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9376"></A>write_eoln_type(Type) -  allows control over which end-of-line (eoln) characters are output by nl/1.  The values for Type and the corresponding eoln characters are: cr (“\r”), lf (“\n”), and crlf (“\r\n”). The default <IMG SRC="studhelp00000001.gif" ALT="studhelp00000001.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=15> is determined by the operating system: MacOS (cr), Unix (lf), and Win32/DOS (crlf).
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9377"></A>read_eoln_type(Type) - determines  what read/2 and get_line/3 recognize as an end-of-line.  The values for Type and the corresponding
ends-of-line are: cr - carriage return (“\r”), lf -   line feed (“\n”), crlf - carriage return followed by a line feed (“\r\n”) , universal - indicates that any of the end-of-line types (cr, lf, crlf) should be interpreted as an end-of-line.  The default is universal since this allows the correct end-of-line interpretation for text files on
all operating systems.

<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9aaa"></A></B>The structured term comprising a stream descriptor is visible to the
programmer.  The programmer should not directly use the stream descriptor to learn of
properties or attributes associated with the stream or otherwise rely on the
representation of stream descriptors.  Use stream_property/2 to examine the properties associated with a stream.
<P></P>
<A NAME="02bb9aab"></A>The DEC-10 compatibility predicates see/1 and tell/1 are defined in terms of open/4.  When a stream is opened with either of these predicates it is assigned an
alias which is the name of the source/sink.  Thus the single argument to see/1 and tell/1 may be considered to be both the name of the stream and an alias for the
stream.
