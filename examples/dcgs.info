Obtaining code:
--------------
Code from Bowen and from Covington et al. can be found on the ALS server:
[From Bowen, the relevant DCG file is grammr.pro.]

* By anonymous ftp:

Login to ftp.als.com as ftp (use your email address as password), and
go to /pub/texts  (see notes below for Web for a discussion of the files):

* From a Web server:

The Web page 
	http://www.als.com/ftp/pub/texts/texts.html
provides a discussion of the textbook code files available in this directory
You can retrieve the code from your web server using the following URLs:
