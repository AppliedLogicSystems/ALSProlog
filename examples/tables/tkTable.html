<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"><B>Widget-specific</B> <B>Options</B></A></H2>

<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>autoclear</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>autoClear</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>AutoClear</B>
<P>
A boolean value which specifies whether the first
keypress in a cell will delete whatever text was previously
there. Defaults to 0.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>bordercursor</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>borderCursor</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Cursor</B>
<P>
Specifies the name of the cursor to show when over
borders, a visual indication that interactive resizing
is allowed (it is thus affect by the value of
-resizeborders). Defaults to <I>crosshair</I>.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>borderwidth</B> <B>or</B> -<B>bd</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>borderWidth</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>BorderWidth</B>
<P>
Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of
the 3-D border to draw on interior table cells (if such
a border is being drawn; the <B>relief</B> option typically
determines this). This can be overridden by the a
tag's borderwidth option. It can also be affected by
the defined <B>-drawmode</B> for the table. The value may
have any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>browsecommand</B> <B>or</B> -<B>browsecmd</B>
Database Name: <B>browseCommand</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>BrowseCommand</B>
<P>
Specifies a command which will be evaluated anytime the
active cell changes. It uses the %-substition model
described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION below.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>cache</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>cache</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Cache</B>
<P>
A boolean value that specifies whether an internal
cache of the table contents should be kept. This
greatly enhances speed performance when used with <B>-command</B>
but uses extra memory. Can maintain state when
both <B>-command</B> and <B>-variable</B> are empty. The cache is
automatically flushed whenever the value of <B>-cache</B> or
<B>-variable</B> changes, otherwise you have to explicitly
<B>flush</B> it. Defaults to false.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>colorigin</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>colOrigin</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Origin</B>
<P>
Specifies what column index to interpret as the leftmost
column in the table. This value is used for user
indices in the table. Defaults to 0.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>cols</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>cols</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Cols</B>
<P>
Number of cols in the table. Defaults to 10.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>colseparator</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>colSeparator</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Separator</B>
<P>
Specifies a separator character that will be interpreted
as the column separator when cutting or pasting
data in a table. By default, columns are separated as
elements of a tcl list.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>colstretchmode</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>colStretchMode</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>StretchMode</B>
<P>
Specifies one of the following stretch modes for
columns to fill extra allocated window space:
<P>
<B>none</B> Columns will not stretch to fill the assigned
<P>
window space. If the columns are too narrow,
there will be a blank space at the right of the
table. This is the default.
<P>
<B>unset</B><BR>

Only columns that do not have a specific width set
will be stretched.
<P>
<B>all</B> All columns will be stretched by the same number
of pixels to fill the window space allocated to
the table. This mode can interfere with interactive
border resizing which tries to force column
width.
<P>
<B>last</B> The last column will be stretched to fill the window
space allocated to the table.
<P>
<B>fill</B> (only valid for <B>-rowstretch</B> currently)
The table will get more or less columns according
to the window space allocated to the table. This
mode has numerous quirks and may disappear in the
future.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>coltagcommand</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>colTagCommand</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>TagCommand</B>
<P>
Provides the name of a procedure that will be evaluated
by the widget to determine the tag to be used for a
given column. When displaying a cell, the table widget
will first check to see if a tag has been defined using
the <B>tag</B> <B>col</B> widget method. If no tag is found, it will
evaluate the named procedure passing the column number
in question as the sole argument. The procedure is
expected to return the name of a tag to use, or a null
string. Errors occuring during the evaluation of the
procedure, or the return of an invalid tag name are
silently ignored.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>colwidth</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>colWidth</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>ColWidth</B>
<P>
Default column width, interpreted as characters in the
default font when the number is positive, or pixels if
it is negative. Defaults to 10.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>command</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>command</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Command</B>
<P>
Specified a command to use as a procedural interface to
cell values. If <B>-usecommand</B> is true, this command will
be used instead of any reference to the <B>-variable</B>
array. When retrieving cell values, the return value
of the command is used as the value for the cell. It
uses the %-substition model described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION
below.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>drawmode</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>drawMode</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>DrawMode</B>
<P>
Sets the table drawing mode to one of the following
options:
<P>
<B>slow</B> The table is drawn to an offscreen pixmap using
the Tk bordering functions (double-buffering).
This means there will be no flashing, but this
mode is slow for larger tables.
<P>
<B>compatible</B><BR>

The table is drawn directly to the screen using
the Tk border functions. It is faster, but the
screen may flash on update. This is the default.
<P>
<B>fast</B> The table is drawn directly to the screen and the
borders are done with fast X calls, so they are
always one pixel wide only. As a side effect, it
restricts <B>-borderwidth</B> to a range of 0 or 1. This
mode provides best performance for large tables,
but can flash on redraw and is not 100% Tk compatible
on the border mode.
<P>
<B>single</B><BR>

The table is drawn to the screen as in fast mode,
but only single pixel lines are drawn (not square
borders).
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>flashmode</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>flashMode</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>FlashMode</B>
<P>
A boolean value which specifies whether cells should
flash when their value changes. The table tag <B>flash</B>
will be applied to these cells for the duration specified
by <B>-flashtime</B>. Defaults to 0.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>flashtime</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>flashTime</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>FlashTime</B>
<P>
The amount of time, in 1/4 second increments, for which
a cell should flash when its value has changed.
<B>-flashmode</B> must be on. Defaults to 2.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>height</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>height</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Height</B>
<P>
Specifies the desired height for the window, in rows.
If zero or less, then the desired height for the window
is made just large enough to hold all the rows in the
table. The height can be further limited by <B>-maxheight</B>.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>invertselected</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>invertSelected</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>InvertSelected</B>
<P>
Specifies whether the foreground and background of an
item should simply have their values swapped instead of
merging the <I>sel</I> tag options when the cell is selected.
Defaults to 0 (merge).
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>maxheight</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>maxHeight</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>MaxHeight</B>
<P>
The max height in pixels that the window will request.
Defaults to 600.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>maxwidth</B><BR>

Specifies the default setting for the multiline tag
option. Defaults to 1.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>resizeborders</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>resizeBorders</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>ResizeBorders</B>
<P>
Specifies what kind of interactive border resizing to
allow, must be one of row, col, both (default) or none.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>rowheight</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>rowHeight</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>RowHeight</B>
<P>
Default row height, interpreted as lines in the default
font when the number is positive, or pixels if it is
negative. Defaults to 1.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>roworigin</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>rowOrigin</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Origin</B>
<P>
Specifies what row index to interpret as the topmost
row in the table. This value is used for user indices
in the table. Defaults to 0.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>rows</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>rows</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Rows</B>
<P>
Number of rows in the table. Defaults to 10.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>rowseparator</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>rowSeparator</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Separator</B>
<P>
Specifies a separator character that will be interpreted
as the row separator when cutting or pasting
data in a table. By default, rows are separated as tcl
lists.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>rowstretchmode</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>rowStretchMode</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>StretchMode</B>
<P>
Specifies the stretch modes for rows to fill extra
allocated window space. See <B>-colstretchmode</B> for valid
options.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>rowtagcommand</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>rowTagCommand</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>TagCommand</B>
<P>
Provides the name of a procedure that can evaluated by
the widget to determine the tag to be used for a given
row. The procedure must be defined by the user to
accept a single argument (the row number), and return a
tag name or null string. This operates in a similar
manner as <B>-coltagcommand</B>, except that it applies to row
tags.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>selectioncommand</B> <B>or</B> -<B>selcmd</B>
Database Name: <B>selectionCommand</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>SelectionCommand</B>
<P>
Specifies a command to evaluate when the selection is
retrieved from a table via the selection mechanism (ie:
evaluating &laquo;<B>selection</B> <B>get</B>"). The return value from
this command will become the string passed on by the
selection mechanism. It uses the %-substition model
described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION below. If an error
occurs, a Tcl background error is generated and nothing
is returned.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>selectmode</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>selectMode</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>SelectMode</B>
<P>
Specifies one of several styles for manipulating the
selection. The value of the option may be arbitrary,
but the default bindings expect it to be either <B>single</B>,
<B>browse</B>, <B>multiple</B>, or <B>extended</B>; the default value is
<B>browse</B>. These styles are like those for the Tk listbox,
except expanded for 2 dimensions.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>selecttitle</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>selectTitles</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>SelectTitles</B>

selection. Defaults to 0 (disallowed).
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>selecttype</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>selectType</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>SelectType</B>
<P>
Specifies one of several types of selection for the
table. The value of the option may be one of <B>row</B>, <B>col</B>,
<B>cell</B>, or <B>both</B> (meaning <B>row</B> <B>&amp;&amp;</B> <B>col</B>); the default value
is <B>cell</B>. These types define whether an entire row/col
is affected when a cell's selection is changed (set or
clear).
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>sparsearray</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>sparseArray</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>SparseArray</B>
<P>
A boolean value that specifies whether an associated
Tcl array should be kept as a sparse array (1, the
default) or as a full array (0). If true, then cell
values that are empty will be deleted from the array
(taking less memory). If false, then all values in the
array will be maintained.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>state</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>state</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>State</B>
<P>
Specifies one of two states for the entry: <B>normal</B> or
<B>disabled</B>. If the table is disabled then the value may
not be changed using widget commands and no insertion
cursor will be displayed, even if the input focus is in
the widget. Also, all insert or delete methods will be
ignored. Defaults to <B>normal</B>.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>titlecols</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>titleCols</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>TitleCols</B>
<P>
Number of columns to use as a title area. Defaults to
0.

Command-Line Name:-<B>titlerows</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>titleRows</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>TitleRows</B>
<P>
Number of rows to use as a title area. Defaults to 0.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>usecommand</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>useCommand</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>UseCommand</B>
<P>
A boolean value which specifies whether to use the <B>command</B>
option. This value sets itself to zero if <B>command</B>
is used and returns an error. Defaults to 1 (will use
<B>command</B> if specified).
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>validate</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>validate</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Validate</B>
<P>
A boolean specifying whether validation should occur
for the active buffer. Defaults to 0.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>validatecommand</B> <B>or</B> -<B>vcmd</B>
Database Name: <B>validateCommand</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>ValidateCommand</B>
<P>
Specifies a command to execute when the active cell is
edited. This command is expected to return a Tcl
boolean. If it returns true, then it is assumed the
new value is OK, otherwise the new value is rejected
(the edition will not take place). Errors in this command
are handled in the background. It uses the %-substition
model described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION below.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>variable</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>variable</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Variable</B>
<P>
Global Tcl array variable to attach to the table's C
array. It will be created if it doesn't already exist
or is a simple variable. Keys used by the table in the
array are of the form <I>row</I>,<I>col</I> for cells and the special
key <I>active</I> which contains the value of the active cell
buffer. The Tcl array is managed as a sparse array
(the table doesn't require all valid indices have
values). No stored value for an index is equivalent to
the empty string, and clearing a cell will remove that
index from the Tcl array, unless the <B>-sparsearray</B>
options is set to 0.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>width</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>width</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Width</B>
<P>
Specifies the desired width for the window, in columns.
If zero or less, then the desired width for the window
is made just large enough to hold all the columns in
the table. The width can be further limited by
<B>-maxwidth</B>.
<P>
Command-Line Name:-<B>wrap</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>wrap</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Wrap</B>
<P>
Specifies the default wrap value for tags. Defaults to
0.<BR>

_________________________________________________________________

<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4"><B>Description</B></A></H2>

<P>
The <B>table</B> command creates a 2-dimensional grid of cells.
The table can use a Tcl array variable or Tcl command for
data storage and retrieval. The widget has an active cell,
the contents of which can be edited (when the state is normal).
The widget supports a default style for the cells and
also multiple <I>tags</I>, which can be used to change the style of
a row, column or cell (see TAGS for details). A cell <I>flash</I>
can be set up so that changed cells will change color for a
specified amount of time ("blink"). Cells can have embedded
images or windows, as described in TAGS and &laquo;EMBEDDED WINDOWS"
respectively.
<P>
One or more cells may be selected as described below. If a
table is exporting its selection (see <B>-exportselection</B>
option), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols for
handling the selection. See THE SELECTION for details.
<P>
It is not necessary for all the cells to be displayed in the
table window at once; commands described below may be used
to change the view in the window. Tables allow scrolling in
both directions using the standard <B>-xscrollcommand</B> and
<B>-yscrollcommand</B> options. They also support scanning, as
described below.
<P>
In order to obtain good performance, the table widget supports
multiple drawing modes, two of which are fully Tk compatible.

<H2><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5"><B>Initialization</B></A></H2>

<P>
When the <B>table</B> command is loaded into an interpreter, a
built-in Tcl command, <B>tkTableInit</B>, is evaluated. This will
search for the appropriate table binding init file to load.
The directories searched are those in $<I>tcl</I>_<I>pkgPath</I>, both
with Tktable(version) appended and without, $<I>tk</I>_<I>library</I> and
[<I>pwd</I>] (the current directory). You can also define an
$<I>env</I>(<I>TK</I>_<I>TABLE</I>_<I>LIBRARY</I>) to head this search list.    By
default, the file searched for is called <B>tkTable.tcl</B>, but
this      can      be      overridden       by       setting
$<I>env</I>(<I>TK</I>_<I>TABLE</I>_<I>LIBRARY</I>_<I>FILE</I>).
<P>
This entire init script can be overridden by providing your
own <B>tkTableInit</B> procedure before the library is loaded.
Otherwise, the aforementioned <I>env</I>(<I>TK</I>_<I>TABLE</I>_<I>LIBRARY</I>) variable
will    be    set    with    the    directory    in    which
$<I>env</I>(<I>TK</I>_<I>TABLE</I>_<I>LIBRARY</I>_<I>FILE</I>) was found.

<H2><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6"><B>Indices</B></A></H2>

<P>
Many of the widget commands for tables take one or more
indices as arguments. An index specifies a particular cell
of the table, in any of the following ways:
<P>
<I>number</I>,<I>number</I><BR>

Specifies the cell as a numerical index of
row,col which corresponds to the index of the
associated        Tcl        array,        where
<B>-roworigin,-colorigin</B> corresponds to the first
cell in the table (0,0 by default).

<DL>

<DT><B>active</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>     Indicates the cell that has the location cursor.
It is specified with the <B>activate</B> widget command.
</DD>

<DT><B>anchor</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>     Indicates the anchor point for the selection,
which is set with the <B>selection</B> <B>anchor</B> widget
command.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
<B>bottomright</B> Indicates the bottom-rightmost cell visible in
the table.

<DL>

<DT><B>end</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>        Indicates the bottom right cell of the table.
</DD>

<DT><B>origin</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>     Indicates the top-leftmost editable cell of the
table, not necessarily in the display. This
takes into account the user specified origin and
title area.
</DD>

<DT><B>topleft</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>    Indicates the top-leftmost editable cell visible
in the table (this excludes title cells).
</DD>

<DT><B>@</B><I>x</I><B>,</B><I>y</I> </DT></DT>
<DD>       Indicates the cell that covers the point in the
table window specified by <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> (in pixel
coordinates). If no cell covers that point,
then the closest cell to that point is used.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
In the widget command descriptions below, arguments named
<I>index</I>, <I>first</I>, and <I>last</I> always contain text indices in one of
the above forms.

<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7"><B>Tags</B></A></H2>

<P>
A tag is a textual string that is associated with zero or
more rows, columns or cells in a table. Tags may contain
arbitrary characters, but it is probably best to avoid using
names which look like indices. There may be any number of
tags associated with rows, columns or cells in a table.
There are several permanent tags in each table that can be
configured by the user and will determine the attributes for
special cells:

<DL>

<DT><B>active</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>   This tag is given to the <I>active</I> cell
</DD>

<DT><B>flash</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>    If flash mode is on, this tag is given to any
recently edited cells.
</DD>

<DT><B>sel</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>      This tag is given to any selected cells.
</DD>

<DT><B>title</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>    This tag is given to any cells in the title
rows and columns. This tag has <B>-state</B> <I>dis</I><B>_</B>a<I>bled</I>
by default.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Tags control the way cells are displayed on the screen.
Where appropriate, the default for displaying cells is
determined by the options for the table widget. However,
display options may be associated with individual tags using
the ``<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>configure</B>'' widget command. If a cell
has been tagged, then the display options associated with
the tag override the default display style. The following
options are currently supported for tags:

<DL>

<DT><B>-anchor</B> <I>anchor</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
Anchor for item in the cell space.
</DD>

<DT><B>-background</B> or <B>-bg</B> <I>color</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Background color of the cell.

<DL>

<DT><B>-borderwidth</B> or <B>-bd</B> <I>pixels</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
Borderwidth of the cell.
</DD>

<DT><B>-font</B> <I>fontName</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
Font for text in the cell.

<DD>
How to justify multi-line text in a cell. It must
be one of <B>left</B>, <B>right</B>, or <B>center</B>.
</DD>

<DT><B>-image</B> <I>imageName</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
An image to display in the cell instead of text.

<DT><B>-multiline</B> <I>boolean</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
Whether to display text with newlines on multiple
lines.
</DD>

<DT><B>-relief</B> <I>relief</I></DT></DT>

</DD>

<DT><B>-showtext</B> <I>boolean</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
Whether to show the text over an image. This does
not currently work on Windows or Mac for all cases
due to the lack of clipping support in Tk's X emulation
(patch submitted).
</DD>

<DT><B>-state</B> <I>state</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
The state of the cell, to allow for certain cells
to be disabled. This prevents the cell from being
edited by the <I>insert</I> or <I>delete</I> methods, but a
direct <I>set</I> will not be prevented.
</DD>

<DT><B>-wrap</B> <I>boolean</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
Whether characters should wrap in a cell that is
not wide enough.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
A priority order is defined among tags, and this order is
used in implementing some of the tag-related functions
described below. When a cell is displayed, its properties
are determined by the tags which are assigned to it.
Including the special tags, this order is <B>flash</B>, <B>active</B>,
<B>sel</B>, <B>title</B>, <B>celltag</B>, <B>rowtag</B>, <B>coltag</B>, default.
<P>
If a cell has several tags associated with it, and if their
display options conflict, then the options of the highest
priority tag are used. If a particular display option
hasn't been specified for a particular tag, or if it is
specified as an empty string, then that option will never be
used; the next-highest-priority tag's option will used
instead. If no tag specifies a particular display option,
then the default style for the widget will be used.
<P>
Images are used for display purposes only. Editing in that
cell will still be enabled and any querying of the cell will
show the text value of the cell, regardless of the value of
<B>-showtext</B>.

<H2><A NAME="sect8" HREF="#toc8"><B>Embedded</B> <B>Windows</B></A></H2>

<P>
There may be any number of embedded windows in a table
widget (one per cell), and any widget may be used as an
embedded window (subject to the usual rules for geometry
management, which require the table window to be the parent
of the embedded window or a descendant of its parent). The
embedded window's position on the screen will be updated as
the table is modified or scrolled, and it will be mapped and
unmapped as it moves into and out of the visible area of the
table widget. Each embedded window occupies one cell's
worth of space in the table widget, and it is referred to by
the index of the cell in the table. Windows associated with
the table widget are destroyed when the table widget is destroyed.
<P>
Windows are used for display purposes only. A value still
exists for that cell, but will not be shown unless the window
is deleted in some way. If the window is destroyed or
lost by the table widget to another geometry manager, then
any data associated with it is lost (the cell it occupied
will no longer appear in <B>window</B> <B>names</B>).
<P>
When an embedded window is added to a table widget with the
window configure widget command, several configuration
options may be associated with it. These options may be
modified with later calls to the window configure widget
command. The following options are currently supported:

<DL>

<DT><B>-create</B> <I>script</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED. Specifies a Tcl script
that may be evaluated to create the window for the
annotation. If no -window option has been specified
for this cell then this script will be
evaluated when the cell is about to be displayed
on the screen. Script must create a window for
the cell and return the name of that window as its
result. If the cell's window should ever be
deleted, the script will be evaluated again the
next time the cell is displayed.
</DD>

<DT><B>-background</B> or <B>-bg</B> <I>color</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Background color of the cell. If not specified,
it uses the table's default background.

<DL>

<DT><B>-padx</B> <I>pixels</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
As defined in the Tk options man page.
</DD>

<DT><B>-pady</B> <I>pixels</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
As defined in the Tk options man page.
</DD>

<DT><B>-relief</B> <I>relief</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
The relief to use for the cell in which the window
lies. If not specified, it uses the table's
default relief.
</DD>

<DT><B>-sticky</B> <I>sticky</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
Stickiness of the window inside the cell, as
defined by the <B>grid</B> command.
</DD>

<DT><B>-window</B> <I>pathName</I></DT></DT>
<DD>
Specifies the name of a window to display in the
annotation. It must exist before being specified
here.
</DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="sect9" HREF="#toc9"><B>the</B> <B>Selection</B></A></H2>

<P>
Table selections are available as type STRING. By default,
the value of the selection will be the values of the
selected cells in nested Tcl list form where each row is a
list and each column is an element of a row list. You can
change the way this value is interpreted by setting the
<B>-rowseparator</B> and <B>-colseparator</B> options. For example,
default Excel format would be to set <B>-rowseparator</B> to &laquo;\n"
and <B>-colseparator</B> to &laquo;\t". Changing these values affects
both how the table sends out the selection and reads in
pasted data, ensuring that the table should always be able
to cut and paste to itself. It is possible to change how
pastes are handled by editing the table library procedure
<B>tk_tablePasteHandler</B>. This might be necessary if <B>-selectioncommand</B>
is set.

<H2><A NAME="sect10" HREF="#toc10"><B>Row/Col</B> <B>Spanning</B></A></H2>

<P>
Individual cells can span multiple rows and/or columns.
This is done via the <B>spans</B> command (see below for exact
arguments). Cells in the title area that span are not permitted
to span beyond the title area, and will be constrained
accordingly. If the title area shrinks during a
configure, sanity checking will occur to ensure the above.
You may set spans on regular cells that extend beyond the
defined row/col area. These spans will not be constrained,
so that when the defined row/col area expands, the span will
expand with it.
<P>
When setting a span, checks are made as to whether the span
would overlap an already spanning or hidden cell. This is
an error and it not allowed. Spans can affect the overall
speed of table drawing, although not significantly. If
spans are not used, then there is no performance loss.
<P>
Cells <I>hidden</I> by spanning cells still have valid data. This
will be seen during cut and paste operations that involve
hidden cells, or through direct access by a command like <B>get</B>
or <B>set</B>.
<P>
The drawing properties of spanning cells apply to only the
visual area of the cell. For example, if a cell is center
justified over 5 columns, then when viewing any portion of
those columns, it will appear centered in the visible area.
The non-visible column area will not be considered in the
centering calculations.

<H2><A NAME="sect11" HREF="#toc11"><B>Command</B> <B>Substitution</B></A></H2>

<P>
The various option based commands that the table supports
all support the familiar Tk %-substitution model (see <B>bind</B>
for more details). The following %-sequences are recognized
and substituted by the table widget:
<P>
<B>%c</B> For <B>SelectionCommand</B>, it is the maximum number of
columns in any row in the selection. Otherwise it is
the column of the triggered cell.

<DL>

<DT><B>%C</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>A convenience substitution for %<I>r</I>,%<I>c</I>.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
<B>%i</B> For <B>SelectionCommand</B>, it is the total number of cells
in the selection. For <B>Command</B>, it is 0 for a read
(get) and 1 for a write (set). Otherwise it is the
current cursor position in the cell.
<P>
<B>%r</B> For <B>SelectionCommand</B>, it is the number of rows in the
selection. Otherwise it is the row of the triggered
cell.
<P>
<B>%s</B> For <B>ValidateCommand</B>, it is the current value of the
cell being validated. For <B>SelectionCommand</B>, it is the
default value of the selection. For <B>BrowseCommand</B>, it
is the index of the last active cell. For <B>Command</B>, it
is empty for reads (get) and the current value of the
cell for writes (set).
<P>
<B>%S</B> For <B>ValidateCommand</B>, it is the potential new value of
the cell being validated. For <B>BrowseCommand</B>, it is the
index of the new active cell.
<P>
<B>%W</B> The pathname to the window for which the command was
generated.

<H2><A NAME="sect12" HREF="#toc12"><B>Widget</B> <B>Command</B></A></H2>

<P>
The <B>table</B> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
<I>pathName</I>. This command may be used to invoke various operations
on the widget. It has the following general form:
<I>pathName</I> <I>option</I> ?<I>arg</I> <I>arg</I> ...?<BR>

<I>Option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s determine the exact behavior of the command.
<P>
The following commands are possible for <B>table</B> widgets:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>activate</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Sets the active cell to the one indicated by <I>index</I>.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>bbox</B> <I>first</I> ?<I>last</I>?<BR>

It returns the bounding box for the specified cell
(range) as a 4-tuple of x, y, width and height in pixels.
It clips the box to the visible portion, if any,
otherwise an empty string is returned.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>border</B> <I>option</I> <I>args</I><BR>

This command is a voodoo hack to implement border sizing
for tables. This is normally called through bindings,
with the following as valid options:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>border</B> <B>mark</B> <I>x</I> <I>y</I> ?<I>row</I>|<I>col</I>?<BR>

Records <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> and the row and/or column border
under that point in the table window, if any; used
in conjunction with later <B>border</B> <B>dragto</B> commands.
Typically this command is associated with a mouse
button press in the widget. If <I>row</I> or <I>col</I> is not
specified, it returns a tuple of both border
indices (an empty item means no border). Otherwise,
just the specified item is returned.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>border</B> <B>dragto</B> <I>x</I> <I>y</I><BR>

This command computes the difference between its <I>x</I>
and <I>y</I> arguments and the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> arguments to the
last <B>border</B> <B>mark</B> command for the widget. It then
adjusts the previously marked border by the
difference. This command is typically associated
with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce
the effect of interactive border resizing.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>cget</B> <I>option</I><BR>

Returns the current value of the configuration option
given by <I>option</I>. <I>Option</I> may have any of the values
accepted by the <B>table</B> command.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>clear</B> <I>option</I> ?<I>first</I>? ?<I>last</I>?
<P>
This command is a convenience routine to clear certain
state information managed by the table. <I>first</I> and <I>last</I>
represent valid table indices. If neither are specified,
then the command operates on the whole table.
The following options are recognized:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>clear</B> <B>cache</B> ?<I>first</I>? ?<I>last</I>?<BR>

Clears the specified section of the cache, if the
table has been keeping one.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>clear</B> <B>sizes</B> ?<I>first</I>? ?<I>last</I>?<BR>

Clears the specified row and column areas of
specific height/width dimensions. When just one
index is specified, for example <B>2,0</B>, that is
interpreted as row 2 <B>and</B> column 0.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>clear</B> <B>tags</B> ?<I>first</I>? ?<I>last</I>?<BR>

Clears the specified area of tags (all row, column
and cell tags).
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>clear</B> <B>all</B> ?<I>first</I>? ?<I>last</I>?<BR>

Performs all of the above clear functions on the
specified area.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>configure</B> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
Query or modify the configuration options of the
widget. If no <I>option</I> is specified, returns a list
describing all of the available options for <I>pathName</I>
(see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the format of
this list). If <I>option</I> is specified with no <I>value</I>, then
the command returns a list describing the one named
option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no <I>option</I> is
specified). If one or more <I>option</I>-<I>value</I> pairs are
specified, then the command modifies the given widget
option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
command returns an empty string. <I>Option</I> may have any
of the values accepted by the <B>table</B> command.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>curselection</B> ?<I>value</I>?<BR>

With no arguments, it returns the sorted indices of the
currently selected cells. Otherwise it sets all the
selected cells to the given value. The set has no
effect if there is no associated Tcl array or the state
is disabled.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>curvalue</B> ?<I>value</I>?<BR>

If no value is given, the value of the cell being
edited (indexed by <B>active</B>) is returned, else it is set
to the given value.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <I>option</I> <I>arg</I> ?<I>arg</I>?
<P>
This command is used to delete various things in a
table. It has several forms, depending on the <I>option</I>:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <B>active</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>index</I>?
Deletes text from the active cell. If only one
index is given, it deletes the character after
that index, otherwise it deletes from the first
index to the second. <I>index</I> can be a number,
<B>insert</B> or <B>end</B>.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <B>cols</B> ?<I>switches</I>? <I>index</I> ?<I>count</I>?
Deletes <I>count</I> cols starting at (and including) col
<I>index</I>. The <I>index</I> will be constrained to the limits
of the tables. If <I>count</I> is negative, it
deletes cols to the left. Otherwise it deletes
cols to the right. <I>count</I> defaults to 1 (meaning
just the column specified). The selection will be
cleared. At the moment, spans are not adjusted
with this action. Optional switches are:

<DL>

<DT><B>-holddimensions</B></DT></DT>
<DD>
Causes the table cols to be unaffected by the
deletion (empty cols may appear). By default
the dimensions are adjusted by <B>count</B>.
</DD>

<DT><B>-holdtags</B></DT></DT>
<DD>
Causes the tags specified by the <I>tag</I> method
to not move along with the data. Also
prevents specific widths set by the <I>width</I>
method from being adjusted. By default,
these tags are properly adjusted.
</DD>

<DT><B>-holdwindows</B></DT></DT>
<DD>
Causes the embedded windows created with the
<I>window</I> method to not move along with the
data. By default, these windows are properly
adjusted.
</DD>

<DT><B>-keeptitles</B></DT></DT>
<DD>
Prevents title area cells from being changed.
Otherwise they are treated just like regular
cells and will move as specified.
</DD>

<DT><B>--</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>Signifies the end of the switches.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <B>rows</B> ?<I>switches</I>? <I>index</I> ?<I>count</I>?
Deletes <B>count</B> rows starting at (and including) row
<B>index</B>. If <B>count</B> is negative, it deletes rows
going up. Otherwise it deletes rows going down.
The selection will be cleared. The switches are
the same as those for column deletion.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>get</B> <I>first</I> ?<I>last</I>?<BR>

Returns the value of the cells specified by the table
indices <I>first</I> and (optionally) <I>last</I> in a list.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>height</B> ?<I>row</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>row</I> <I>value</I> ...?
If no <I>row</I> is specified, returns a list describing all
rows for which a height has been set. If <B>row</B> is specified
with no value, it prints out the height of that
row in characters (positive number) or pixels (negative
number). If one or more <I>row</I>-<I>value</I> pairs are specified,
then it sets each row to be that height in lines (positive
number) or pixels (negative number). If <I>value</I> is
<I>default</I>, then the row uses the default height, specified
by <B>-rowheight</B>.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>hidden</B> ?<I>index</I>? ?<I>index</I> ...?<BR>

When called without args, it returns all the <I>hidden</I>
cells (those cells covered by a spanning cell). If one
index is specified, it returns the spanning cell covering
that index, if any. If multiple indices are specified,
it returns 1 if all indices are hidden cells, 0
otherwise.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>icursor</B> ?<I>arg</I>?<BR>

With no arguments, prints out the location of the
insertion cursor in the active cell. With one argument,
sets the cursor to that point in the string. 0
is before the first character, you can also use <B>insert</B>
or <B>end</B> for the current insertion point or the end of
the text. If there is no active cell, or the cell or
table is disabled, this will return -1.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>index</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>row</I>|<I>col</I>?<BR>

Returns the integer cell coordinate that corresponds to
<I>index</I> in the form row,col. If <B>row</B> or <B>col</B> is specified,
then only the row or column index is returned.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>insert</B> <I>option</I> <I>arg</I> <I>arg</I><BR>

This command is used to into various things into a
table. It has several forms, depending on the <I>option</I>:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>insert</B> <B>active</B> <I>index</I> <I>value</I><BR>

The <I>value</I> is a text string which is inserted at
the <I>index</I> postion of the active cell. The cursor
is then positioned after the new text. <I>index</I> can
be a number, <B>insert</B> or <B>end</B>.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>insert</B> <B>cols</B> ?<I>switches</I>? <I>index</I> ?<I>count</I>?
Inserts <B>count</B> cols starting at col <B>index</B>. If
<B>count</B> is negative, it inserts before the specified
col. Otherwise it inserts after the specified
col. The selection will be cleared. The switches
are the same as those for column deletion.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>insert</B> <B>rows</B> ?<I>switches</I>? <I>index</I> ?<I>count</I>?
Inserts <B>count</B> rows starting at row <B>index</B>. If
<B>count</B> is negative, it inserts before the specified
row. Otherwise it inserts after the specified
row. The selection will be cleared. The switches
are the same as those for column deletion.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>reread</B><BR>

Rereads the old contents of the cell back into the
editing buffer. Useful for a key binding when &lt;Escape&gt;
is pressed to abort the edit (a default binding).
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>scan</B> <I>option</I> <I>args</I><BR>

This command is used to implement scanning on tables.
It has two forms, depending on <I>option</I>:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>scan</B> <B>mark</B> <I>x</I> <I>y</I><BR>

Records <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> and the current view in the table
window; used in conjunction with later <B>scan</B>
<B>dragto</B> commands. Typically this command is associated
with a mouse button press in the widget.
It returns an empty string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>scan</B> <B>dragto</B> <I>x</I> <I>y</I>.<BR>

This command computes the difference between its <I>x</I>
and <I>y</I> arguments and the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> arguments to the
last <B>scan</B> <B>mark</B> command for the widget. It then
adjusts the view by 5 times the difference in
coordinates. This command is typically associated
with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce
the effect of dragging the list at high speed
through the window. The return value is an empty
string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>see</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Adjust the view in the table so that the cell given by
<I>index</I> is positioned as the cell one off from top left
(excluding title rows and columns) if the cell is not
currently visible on the screen. The actual cell may
be different to keep the screen full.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <I>option</I> <I>arg</I><BR>

This command is used to adjust the selection within a
table. It has several forms, depending on <I>option</I>:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>anchor</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Sets the selection anchor to the cell given by
<I>index</I>. The selection anchor is the end of the
selection that is fixed while dragging out a
selection with the mouse. The index <B>anchor</B> may be
used to refer to the anchor cell.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>clear</B> <I>first</I> ?<I>last</I>?
If any of the cells between <I>first</I> and <I>last</I>
(inclusive) are selected, they are deselected.
The selection state is not changed for cells outside
this range. <I>first</I> may be specified as <B>all</B> to
remove the selection from all cells.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>includes</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Returns 1 if the cell indicated by <I>index</I> is
currently selected, 0 if it isn't.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>set</B> <I>first</I> ?<I>last</I>?<BR>

Selects all of the cells in the range between
<I>first</I> and <I>last</I>, inclusive, without affecting the
selection state of cells outside that range.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>set</B> ?<I>row</I>|<I>col</I>? <I>index</I> ?<I>value</I>? ?<I>index</I> <I>value</I> ...?
Sets the specified index to the associated value.
Table validation will not be triggered via this method.
If <B>row</B> or <B>col</B> precedes the list of index/value pairs,
then the value is assumed to be a Tcl list whose values
will be split and set into the subsequent columns (if
<B>row</B> is specified) or rows (for <B>col</B>). For example, <B>set</B>
<B>row</B> <B>2,3</B> <B>{2,3</B> <B>2,4</B> <B>2,5}</B> will set 3 cells, from 2,3 to
2,5. The setting of cells is silently bounded by the
known table dimensions.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>spans</B> ?<I>index</I>? ?<I>rows</I>,<I>cols</I> <I>index</I> <I>rows</I>,<I>cols</I> ...?
This command is used to manipulate row/col spans. When
called with no arguments, all known spans are returned
as a list of tuples of the form {index span}. When
called with only the <I>index</I>, the span for that <I>index</I>
only is returned, if any. Otherwise an even number of
<I>index</I> <I>rows</I>,<I>cols</I> pairs are used to set spans. A span
starts at the <I>index</I> and continues for the specified
number of rows and cols. Negative spans are not supported.
A span of 0,0 unsets any span on that cell.
See EXAMPLES for more info.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> option ?<I>arg</I> <I>arg</I> ...?<BR>

This command is used to manipulate tags. The exact
behavior of the command depends on the <I>option</I> argument
that follows the <B>tag</B> argument. <I>cget</I>, <I>cell</I>, and <I>row</I>|<I>col</I>
complain about unknown tag names. The following forms
of the command are currently supported:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>cell</B> <I>tagName</I> ?<I>index</I> ...?
With no arguments, prints out the list of cells
that use the <I>tag</I>. Otherwise it sets the specified
cells to use the <I>tag</I>. If <I>tag</I> is {}, the cells are
reset to the default <I>tag</I>. Tags added during
-*tagcommand evaluation do not register here.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>cget</B> <I>tagName</I> <I>option</I><BR>

This command returns the current value of the
option named <I>option</I> associated with the tag given
by <I>tagName</I>. <I>Option</I> may have any of the values
accepted by the <B>tag</B> <B>configure</B> widget command.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>col</B> <I>tagName</I> ?<I>col</I> ...?<BR>

With no arguments, prints out the list of cols
that use the <I>tag</I>. Otherwise it sets the specified
cols to use the <I>tag</I>. If <I>tag</I> is {}, the cols are
reset to the default <I>tag</I>. Tags added during -coltagcommand
evaluation do not register here. If
<I>tagName</I> does not exist, it is not created, but nor
is an error generated.
<P>
<I>value</I> ...?<BR>

<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>configure</B> <I>tagName</I> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I>? ?<I>option</I>
This command is similar to the <B>configure</B> widget
command except that it modifies options associated
with the tag given by <I>tagName</I> instead of modifying
options for the overall table widget. If no
<I>option</I> is specified, the command returns a list
describing all of the available options for <I>tag</I><B>_N</B><I>ame</I>
(see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the
format of this list). If <I>option</I> is specified with
no <I>value</I>, then the command returns a list describing
the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value
returned if no <I>option</I> is specified). If one or
more <I>option</I>-<I>value</I> pairs are specified, then the
command modifies the given option(s) to have the
given value(s) in <I>tagName</I>; in this case the command
returns an empty string. See TAGS above for
details on the options available for tags.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>delete</B> <I>tagName</I><BR>

Deletes a tag. No error if the tag does not
exist.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>exists</B> <I>tagName</I><BR>

Returns 1 if the named tag exists, 0 otherwise.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>includes</B> <I>tagName</I> <I>index</I><BR>

Returns 1 if the specified index has the named
tag, 0 otherwise.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>names</B> ?<I>pattern</I>?<BR>

If no pattern is specified, shows the names of all
defined tags. Otherwise the <I>pattern</I> is used as a
glob pattern to show only tags matching that pattern.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>row</B> <I>tagName</I> ?<I>row</I> ...?<BR>

With no arguments, prints out the list of rows
that use the <I>tag</I>. Otherwise it sets the specified
rows to use the <I>tag</I>. If <I>tag</I> is {}, the rows are
reset to use the default tag. Tags added during
-rowtagcommand evaluation do not register here.
If <I>tagName</I> does not exist, it is not created, but
nor is an error generated.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>validate</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Explicitly validates the specified index based on the
current <B>-validatecommand</B> and returns 0 or 1 based on
whether the cell was validated.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>width</B> ?<I>col</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>col</I> <I>value</I> ...?
If no <I>col</I> is specified, returns a list describing all
cols for which a width has been set. If <B>col</B> is specified
with no value, it prints out the width of that col
in characters (positive number) or pixels (negative
number). If one or more <I>col</I>-<I>value</I> pairs are specified,
then it sets each col to be that width in characters
(positive number) or pixels (negative number). If
<I>value</I> is <I>default</I>, then the col uses the default width,
specified by <B>-colwidth</B>.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>window</B> option ?<I>arg</I> <I>arg</I> ...?<BR>

This command is used to manipulate embedded windows.
The exact behavior of the command depends on the <I>option</I>
argument that follows the <B>window</B> argument. The following
forms of the command are currently supported:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>window</B> <B>cget</B> <I>index</I> <I>option</I><BR>

This command returns the current value of the
option named <I>option</I> associated with the window
given by <I>index</I>. <I>Option</I> may have any of the values
accepted by the <B>window</B> <B>configure</B> widget command.
<P>
<I>value</I> ...?<BR>

<I>pathName</I> <B>window</B> <B>configure</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I>? ?<I>option</I>
This command is similar to the <B>configure</B> widget
command except that it modifies options associated
with the embedded window given by <I>index</I> instead of
modifying options for the overall table widget.
If no <I>option</I> is specified, the command returns a
list describing all of the available options for
<I>index</I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the
format of this list). If <I>option</I> is specified with
no <I>value</I>, then the command returns a list describing
the one named option (this list will be
identical to the corresponding sublist of the
value returned if no <I>option</I> is specified). If one
or more <I>option</I>-<I>value</I> pairs are specified, then the
command modifies the given option(s) to have the
given value(s) in <I>index</I>; in this case the command
returns an empty string. See EMBEDDED WINDOWS
above for details on the options available for
windows.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>window</B> <B>delete</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>index</I> ...?
Deletes an embedded window from the table. The
associated window will also be deleted.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>window</B> <B>move</B> <I>indexFrom</I> <I>indexTo</I>
Moves an embedded window from one cell to another.
If a window already exists in the target cell, it
will be deleted.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>window</B> <B>names</B> ?<I>pattern</I>?<BR>

If no pattern is specified, shows the cells of all
embedded windows. Otherwise the <I>pattern</I> is used
as a glob pattern to show only cells matching that
pattern.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>xview</B> <I>args</I><BR>

This command is used to query and change the horizontal
position of the information in the widget's window. It
can take any of the following forms:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>xview</B><BR>

Returns a list containing two elements. Each element
is a real fraction between 0 and 1; together
they describe the horizontal span that is visible
in the window. For example, if the first element
is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the
table's text is off-screen to the left, the middle
40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the text
is off-screen to the right. These are the same
values passed to scrollbars via the <B>-xscrollcommand</B>
option.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>xview</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Adjusts the view in the window so that the column
given by <I>index</I> is displayed at the left edge of
the window.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>xview</B> <B>moveto</B> <I>fraction</I><BR>

Adjusts the view in the window so that <I>fraction</I> of
the total width of the table text is off-screen to
the left. <I>fraction</I> must be a fraction between 0
and 1.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>xview</B> <B>scroll</B> <I>number</I> <I>what</I><BR>

This command shifts the view in the window left or
right according to <I>number</I> and <I>what</I>. <I>Number</I> must
be an integer. <I>What</I> must be either <B>units</B> or <B>pages</B>
or an abbreviation of one of these. If <I>what</I> is
<B>units</B>, the view adjusts left or right by <I>number</I>
character units (the width of the <B>0</B> character) on
the display; if it is <B>pages</B> then the view adjusts
by <I>number</I> screenfuls. If <I>number</I> is negative then
characters farther to the left become visible; if
it is positive then characters farther to the
right become visible.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>yview</B> ?<I>args</I>?<BR>

This command is used to query and change the vertical
position of the text in the widget's window. It can
take any of the following forms:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>yview</B><BR>

Returns a list containing two elements, both of
which are real fractions between 0 and 1. The
first element gives the position of the table element
at the top of the window, relative to the
table as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through
the table, for example). The second element gives
the position of the table element just after the
last one in the window, relative to the table as a
whole. These are the same values passed to
scrollbars via the <B>-yscrollcommand</B> option.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>yview</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Adjusts the view in the window so that the row
given by <I>index</I> is displayed at the top of the window.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>yview</B> <B>moveto</B> <I>fraction</I><BR>

Adjusts the view in the window so that the element
given by <I>fraction</I> appears at the top of the window.
<I>Fraction</I> is a fraction between 0 and 1; 0
indicates the first element in the table, 0.33
indicates the element one-third the way through
the table, and so on.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>yview</B> <B>scroll</B> <I>number</I> <I>what</I><BR>

This command adjusts the view in the window up or
down according to <I>number</I> and <I>what</I>. <I>Number</I> must be
an integer. <I>What</I> must be either <B>units</B> or <B>pages</B>.
If <I>what</I> is <B>units</B>, the view adjusts up or down by
<I>number</I> lines; if it is <B>pages</B> then the view adjusts
by <I>number</I> screenfuls. If <I>number</I> is negative then
earlier elements become visible; if it is positive
then later elements become visible.

<H2><A NAME="sect13" HREF="#toc13"><B>Default</B> <B>Bindings</B></A></H2>

<P>
The initialization creates class bindings that give the following
default behaviour:
<P>
[1] Clicking Button-1 in a cell activates that cell.
Clicking into an already active cell moves the insertion
cursor to the character nearest the mouse.
<P>
[2] Moving the mouse while Button-1 is pressed will stroke
out a selection area. Exiting while Button-1 is
pressed causing scanning to occur on the table along
with selection.
<P>
[3] Moving the mouse while Button-2 is pressed causes scanning
to occur without any selection.
<P>
[4] Home moves the table to have the origin in view.
<P>
[5] End moves the table to have the <B>end</B> cell in view.
<P>
[6] Control-Home moves the table to the origin and
activates that cell.
<P>
[7] Control-End moves the table to the end and activates
that cell.
<P>
[8] Shift-Control-Home extends the selection to the origin.
<P>
[9] Shift-Control-End extends the selection to the end.
<P>
[10] The left, right, up and down arrows move the active
cell.
<P>
[11] Shift-&lt;arrow&gt; extends the selection in that direction.
<P>
[12] Control-leftarrow and Control-rightarrow move the
insertion cursor within the cell.
<P>
[13] Control-slash selects all the cells.
<P>
[14] Control-backslash clears selection from all the cells.
<P>
[15] Backspace deletes the character before the insertion
cursor in the active cell.
<P>
[16] Delete deletes the character after the insertion cursor
in the active cell.
<P>
[17] Escape rereads the value of the active cell from the
specified data source, discarding any edits that have
may been performed on the cell.
<P>
[18] Control-a moves the insertion cursor to the beginning
of the active cell.
<P>
[19] Control-e moves the insertion cursor to the end of the
active cell.
<P>
[20] Control-minus and Control-equals decrease and increase
the width of the column with the active cell in it.
<P>
[21] Moving the mouse while Button-3 (the right button on
Windows) is pressed while you are over a border will
cause interactive resizing of that row and/or column to
occur, based on the value of <B>-resizeborders</B>.
<P>
Some bindings may have slightly different behavior dependent
on the <B>-selectionmode</B> of the widget.
<P>
If the widget is disabled using the <B>-state</B> option, then its
view can still be adjusted and cells can still be selected,
but no insertion cursor will be displayed and no cell modifications
will take place.
<P>
The behavior of tables can be changed by defining new bindings
for individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.
The default bindings are either compiled in or read
from a file expected to correspond to: &laquo;[lindex $tcl_pkgPath
0]/Tktable&lt;version&gt;/tkTable.tcl".

<H2><A NAME="sect14" HREF="#toc14"><B>Performance</B> <B>Issues</B></A></H2>

<P>
The number of rows and columns or a table widget should not
significantly affect the speed of redraw. Recalculation and
redraw of table parameters and cells is restricted as much
as possible.
<P>
The display cell with the insert cursor is redrawn each time
the cursor blinks, which causes a steady stream of graphics
traffic. Set the <B>-insertofftime</B> option to 0 avoid this.
The use of a <B>-command</B> with the table without a cache can
cause significant slow-down, as the command is called once
for each request of a cell value.

<H2><A NAME="sect15" HREF="#toc15"><B>Examples</B></A></H2>

<P>
Set the topleft title area to be one spanning cell. This
overestimates both row and column span by one, but the command
does all the constraining for us.<BR>

$table span [$table cget -roworigin],[$table cget -colorigin] [$table cget -titlerows],[$table cget -titlecols]
Force a table window refresh (useful for the slight chance
that a bug in the table is not causing proper refresh):
$table configure -padx [$table cget -padx]
