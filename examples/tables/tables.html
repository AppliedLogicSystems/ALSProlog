<center><h2>Interface between ALS Prolog and Tktable</h2></center>

The <a href="tkTable.html">Tktable package</a> developed by Jeff Hobbes is a powerful package
for creating and manipulating on-screen tables.  The basic demos
supplied with the Tktable package include a framework for a multi-page 
spreadsheet.
<p>
The file <tt>tables.pro</tt> defines a Prolog interface to the Tktable 
package, providing 
a natural set of Prolog predicates for dealing with Tk tables. The full
forms of these predicates provide a number of parameters, including the
Tcl/Tk interpreter in which to execute, and return values.  For all of the
predicates, there are convenient (short) forms supplying defaults (such
as the "standard" interpreter "tcli") and ignoring return values.
<p>
<b>load_table_package/0.</b>
<pre>
Short form defined by:
     load_table_package :- 
        load_table_package(tcli).
</pre>

<b>load_table_package/1.</b>
<pre>
load_table_package(Interp)
load_table_package(+)
</pre>
    Calls init_tk_alslib(Interm), and then loads the TkTable package.
    Calling it more than once has no effect.
<p>
<b>create_table/2</b>
<pre>
create_table(TableName, Options)
create_table(+, +)
Short form defined by:
    create_table(TableName, Options) :-
        create_table(TableName, Options, tcli).
</pre>

<b>create_table/3</b>
<pre>
create_table(TableName, Options, Interp)
create_table(+, +, +)
Short form defined by:
    create_table(TableName, Options, Interp) :-
        create_table_r(TableName, Options, Interp, _).
</pre>

<b>create_table_r/3</b>
<pre>
create_table_r(TableName, Options, R)
create_table_r(+, +, -)
Short form defined by:
    create_table_r(TableName, Options, R) :-
        create_table_r(TableName, Options, tcli, XOpts, R).
</pre>

<b>create_table_r/5</b>
<pre>
create_table_r(TableName, Options, Interp, XOpts, R)
create_table_r(+, +, +, +, -)
</pre>

TableName and Interp must be atoms; R should be an uninstantiated variable.
Creates a table called TableName in Tcl/Tk interpreter Interp, and unifies R
with a list of seven (7) atoms (in this order) as follows:
<pre>
	the Tk pathname of the actual table entity;
	the name of the associated Tcl data array;
	the name of the associated Tcl info array;
	the Tk pathname of the top level window containing the table;
	the Tk pathname of the menubar, if requested, and '' otherwise;
	the Tk pathname of the upper pane, if requested, and '' otherwise;
	the Tk pathname of the lower pane, if requested, and '' otherwise;
</pre>
The properties of TableName are 
configure by the options occuring on the list Options, or the list XOpts.
In addition, the call the create_table_r/5 (and implicitly, all of the
other create_tableXX/NN calls) define (assert) specific predicates for 
accessing the cells, rows, and columns of TableName.  These are described
following the discussion table configuration options.
<p>
Note that Tktable uses zero-based indexing for the cells of the table proper,
and uses negative integer-based indexing for the cells of the column and row
headings.  The indicies on r_,_ in the following example (basic.tcl from the
Tktable demos) illustrates the situtation:
<br> <center> <img src="basic_table.gif" > </center> <br>
The elements of the lists Options and XOpts are terms ("equations') of the 
form Tag=Value.  Each of these provides a value to a corresponding option in the
call to Tktable.  In general, these are passed to the Tktable as options
in the form
<pre>
                -Tag Value
</pre>

A certain amount of transformation, error-checking, and supplying of
defaults of provided for equations on the list Options.  
For equations occurring on the list Options, Tag must be
one of the following recognized atoms:
<pre>

         numcols,       colheadings,   titlerows,    roworigin,    
         numrows,       rowheadings,   titlecols,    colorigin,    
         title,         font,          foreground,   background, 
         selectmode,    rowstretch,    colstretch,   flashmode,    
         menubar,       upperpane,     lowerpane
</pre>

The equations on the XOpts also are viewed as providing option values to the 
Tktable call.  However, absolutely no checks are performed, even as to whether
Tag really names a Tktable option.  The pair "-Tag Value" is simply
passed directly to the Tktable call.  It is the programmer's responsibility
ensure that Tag=Value equations on XOpts are correct.
<p>
The values, defaults, and effects of the options on the Options list are 
given below.  Note that some of the defaults provided by this interface
are different than the defaults of the basic Tktable.
<p>
colheadings = ColHeadings [list of atoms; [] ] <br>
numcols = NumCols [integer; 10] <br>
titlerows = NumTitleRows [integer; 1] <br>
colorigin = ColOrigin [integer; -1] <br>
<p>
This group of options controls column organization.  ColHeadings is a list of 
atoms to serve as column headings.  If ColHeadings \= [] is supplied, then 
the other options (numcols, titlerows, roworigin) are ignored.  Instead, 
NumCols is set to 1 plus the length of ColHeadings, NumTitleRows (the number of
rows at top for column titles) is set to 1, and 
ColOrigin (the column index of the topmost row) is set to -1.  
<p>
rowheadings = RowHeading [list of atoms; [] ] <br>
numrows = NumRows [integer; 10] <br>
titlecols = NumTitleCols [integer; 1] <br>
roworigin = RowOrigin [integer; -1] <br>
<p>
This group of options controls row organization.  RowHeadings is a list of 
atoms to serve as row labels.  If RowHeadings \= [] is supplied, then 
the other options (numrows, titlerows, roworigin) are ignored.  Instead, 
NumRows is set to 1 plus the length of RowHeadings, NumTitleCols (the number of
columns at left for row labels) is set to 1, and 
RowOrigin (the column index of the leftmost column) is set to -1.  
<p>
title = Title [atom; ''] <br>
The title on the top window bar.
<p>
For details concerning the following options, see the 
<a href="tkTable.html">Tktable manual page</a> together with the font
and color Tcl manual pages:
<p>
font = Font [Tcl font description (atom); system default] <br>
foreground = Color [Tcl color description (atom); black] <br>
background = Color [Tcl color description (atom); #b9b9b9 (grey)] <br>
selectmode = SelectMode [single/browse/multiple/extended; extended] <br>
rowstretch = RowStrech [atom (none/unset/all/last/fill); unset ] <br>
colstretch = ColStretch [atom (none/unset/all/last/fill); unset ] <br>
flashmode = FlashMode [on/off; on]

<p>
The only allowed value for the following tags is the value 'true'. The
presence of one of these equations
<pre>
          menubar = true
          upperpane = true
          lowerpane = true
</pre>
on the OptionsList requests a certain additional feature be added to
the top level window containing the table, as follows:
<ul>
<li> <TT>menubar = true</TT>  -- add a menubar;
<li> <TT>upperpane = true</TT> -- add a frame between the top of the parent window (or
the menubar, if present), and the table; the frame extends the full width of
the parent window;
<li> <TT>lowerpane = true</TT> -- add a frame between the bottom of the parent window 
and the table; the frame extends the full width of the parent window;
</ul>
The Tk path names of these items are returned in the last entries of the
list bound to argument 5 (R) by the call create_table_r/5.  Nothing is 
done to these items by create_table_r/5 other than to create them and
place them in the grid managing the window.  It is up to the code calling
create_table_r/5 to obtain the paths and populate these items as desired.
<p>
The call 
<pre>
    create_table_r(TableName, Options, Interp, XOpts, R)
</pre>
also defines several specific predicates for accessing the cells, rows,
and columns of TableName.  These are asserted in the module in which the
call to create_tableXX/NN occurs. (The create_tableXX/NN predicates are 
all metapredicates.)  The predicates defined are the following:
<p>
<b>basic_table_info(TableName,NRows,NCols)</b>
 <br>   A simple assertion, for convenience.
<p>
<b>set_</b><i>TableName</i><b>_table(Row,Col,Val)</b>
<br>    Inserts Val in cell Row,Col, overwriting any previous value.
<p>
<b>read_<i>TableName</i>_table(Row,Col,Val)</b>
<br>    Unifies Val with the value currently contained in cell Row,Col.
<p>
<b>set_<i>TableName</i>_row(RowN,ColStart,ValsList)</b>
<br>    RowN and ColStart are integers in suitable ranges, and ValsList is 
    a list of values.  On RowN, beginning in column ColStart, recurses
    down the list ValsList, inserting the values in the cells
<pre>
        RowN,ColStart,  RowN,ColStart+1, ...
</pre>
    Terminates when either the end of ValsList is reached, or the end
    of RowN is reached; in the latter case, any remaining entries on
    ValsList are simply discarded.
<p>
<b>set_<i>TableName</i>_col(ColN,RowStart,ValsList)</b>
<br>    ColN and RowStart are integers in suitable ranges, and ValsList is 
    a list of values.  On ColN, beginning in row RowStart, recurses
    down the list ValsList, inserting the values in the cells
<pre>
        ColN,RowStart,  ColN,RowStart+1, ...
</pre>
    Terminates when either the end of ValsList is reached, or the end
    ColN is reached; in the latter case, any remaining entries on
    ValsList are simply discarded.

<p>
The following additional predicates, which take TableName as a parameter,
are available:

<p>
<b>table_set_tag/3.</b>
<pre>
table_set_tag(TableName, TagName, Properties)
table_set_tag(+, +, +)
Short form defined by:
    table_set_tag(TableName, TagName, Properties) :-
        table_set_tag(TableName, TagName, Properties, tcli).
</pre>


<p>
<b>table_set_tag/4.</b>
<pre>
table_set_tag(TableName, TagName, Properties, Interp)
table_set_tag(+, +, +, +)
</pre>

TableName must have already been created.  TagName must be an atom,
and Properties must be a list of equations Prop=Value where Prop is
suitable for application to a Tktable tag (...) and Value is an
appropriate value for Prop.  The call
<pre>
    table_set_tag(TableName, TagName, Properties, Interp)
</pre>
establishes TagName as a tag for TableName with the corresponding
properties applied.


<p>
<b>table_tag_region/3.</b>
<pre>
table_tag_region(TableName, TagName, Region)
table_tag_region(+, +, +)
Short form defined by:
    table_tag_region(TableName, TagName, Region) :-
        table_tag_region(TableName, TagName, Region, tcli).
</pre>

<b>table_tag_region/4.</b>
<pre>
table_tag_region(TableName, TagName, Region, Interp)
table_tag_region(+, +, +, +)
</pre>

TableName must have been created, and TagName must be a tag for TableName
previously established by one or more calls to table_set_tag/_.
Applies the tag TagName to region Region in table TableName,
where Region is term describing regions as follows:

<pre>
    cell(R,C) - the cell at row R, col C
    row(R)      - all of row R
    col(C)      - all of col C
    colsblock(C1,C2)    - all cols from col C1 to col C2, C1 =< C2;
    rowsblock(R1,R2)    - all rows from row R1 to row R2, R1 =< R2.
</pre>
