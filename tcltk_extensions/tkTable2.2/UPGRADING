For those users who became familiar with v1.x of tkTable, there are
several changes in v2.x that might affect you.  If v2.x is new to you,
then just read the man page (or HTML equivalent).

The format of this upgrade document is to define the area of the change and
the show the old code and its new equivalent.  Comments may follow for
seemingly obscure changes.  Not all the new features are listed (we just
want you to be able to upgrade old code), so don't forget to look through
the documentation for new procedures that will make previous tasks easier.

METHOD CHANGES:

* new "window" method for embedded windows

MISC CHANGES:

* No more explicit Kanji or incr Tcl support.  Kanji support will come
with using the new core UTF support, and incr Tcl for Tcl8 will just
be another loadable library.

* -rowheight now supports line and pixel sizes, but positive
numbers now mean size in lines instead of pixels.

* <Return> binding now puts a \n into the cell instead of moving
to the next cell
