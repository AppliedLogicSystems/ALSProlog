The Development Env. > Tools page contains the following, which needs to be handled:

    Selecting **Debugger** provides access to the GUI Debugger; this will be described     in detail in [Chapter 18(_[Using,the,ALS,IDE,Debugger]_)](href = start.htm).

Also, there is a Visual Tcl button that does nothing: Find out ....

Also, add info about Cref; Also: when Cref is clicked, it is loaded, but there is a syntax error.
