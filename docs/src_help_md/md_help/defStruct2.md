`defStruct/2` â€” specify an abstract data type


## FORMS

:- defStruct(TypeID, Equations) .


## DESCRIPTION

Used as a directive to specify an
abstract
datatype.
TypeID is an atom functioning identifying the type.
Equations is a list of
_[equality][statements]_
of the form :

Left = Right

where the left component of the equality statements must be one of :

- propertiesList

- accessPred

- setPred

- makePred

- structLabel

The right sides of equality statements are Prolog terms whose structure depends on the left side entry. The right side corresponding to propertiesList is a list of atoms which are the symbolic names of the properties or slots of the structure being defined. For all of the rest of the equality statements, the right side is a single atom.

accessPred The name of the ternary(3-argument) predicate to be used for accessing the values of the slots in the structure. Calls on a generated accessPred take the form

&lt; accessPred &gt;(&lt; slotname &gt;, &lt; Structure &gt;, Value)

setPred The name of the ternary(3-argument) predicate to be used for setting or changing the values of the slots in the structure. Calls on a generated accessPred take the form

&lt; setPred &gt;(&lt; slotname &gt;, &lt; Structure &gt;, Value)


makePred The name of the unary predicate used for obtaining a fresh structure of the defined type.

structLabel The name of the functor of the structure defined.

propertiesList A list of
**_[slot][specifications,,]_**
as follows :

- an atom, which is the name of the particular slot, or

- an expression of the form

SlotName/Term,

where
SlotName is an atom serving as the name of this slot, and Term is an arbitrary Prolog term which is the default value of this particular slot, or

- an
**_[include]_**
expression which is a term of the form

include(File, Type)

where File is a path to a file, and Type is the name of a defStruct which appears in that file; if File can be located, and if the defStruct Type appears in File, the elements of propertiesList for Type are interpolated at the point where the
include

expression occurred;
include

expressions may be recursively nested. [Note : Relative paths in recursive includes must be valid from the directory in which the defStruct directive was invoked. ]


## EXAMPLES

:- defStruct(windows,

[

propertiesList =

[windowName, % name of the window

windowNum, % assigned by window sys

borderColor/blue, % for color displays

borderType/sing, % single or double lines

uLR, uLC, % coords(Row, Col) of

% upper Left corner

lRR, lRC, % coords(Row, Col) of

% lower Right corner

fore/black, % foreground/background

back / white % text attribs

],

accessPred = accessWI,

setPred = setWI,

makePred = makeWindowStruct,

structLabel = wi

]

) .

Then :

..., makeWindowStruct(WIN),

..., setWI(windowName, WIN, foo),

..., accessWI(borderColor, WIN, BColor), ...
