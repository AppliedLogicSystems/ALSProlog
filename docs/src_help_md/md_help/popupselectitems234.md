`popup_select_items/ [2, 3, 4]` â€” present popup selection list


## FORMS

popup_select_items(SourceList, ChoiceList)

popup_select_items(SourceList, Options, ChoiceList)

popup_select_items(Interp, SourceList, Options, ChoiceList)


## DESCRIPTION

These present popup lists to the user, who is expected to choose one or more items. The shorter versions are defined by

popup_select_items(SourceList, ChoiceList)

:-

popup_select_items(tcli, SourceList, [ ],

ChoiceList) .


popup_select_items(SourceList, Options, ChoiceList)

:-

popup_select_items(tcli, SourceList, Options,

ChoiceList) .

For the general call

popup_select_items(Interp, SourceList, Options,

ChoiceList)

Interp should be an atom naming a Tcl interpreter, SourceList should be a list of atoms, ChoiceList should be an uninstantiated variable, and Options should be a list of equations of the forms :

mode = SelectMode

title = Atom

where SelectMode is one of :

browse single multiple extended

If the selection mode is
single

or
_[brow][se]_
, at most one element can be selected in the listbox at once. In both of these modes, clicking button 1 on an element selects it and deselects any other selected item. In
browse

mode it is also possible to drag the selection with button 1

If the selection mode is
_[multipl][e]_
or
_[exten][ded]_
, any number of elements may be selected at once, including discontiguous ranges. In
multiple

mode, clicking button 1 on an element toggles its selection state without affecting any other elements. In
extended

mode, pressing button 1 on an element selects it, deselects everything else, and sets the anchor to the element under the mouse; dragging the mouse with button 1 down extends the selection to include all the ele ments between the anchor and the element under the mouse, inclusive.


## EXAMPLES

The call

? - popup_select_items(

[ ' The first item ', ' Item #2 ',

' Item three ', the_final_item ],

Selection) .


produces the popup shown below. :

![](images/popup_list_select-1.gif)

In this case, the user is allowed to select a single item; if the user selected " Item three " and clicked OK, the result would be :

Selection = [Item three ].

Even though in this case the user was restricted to selection of one item, the

popup_select_items/_ predicate returns a list of the selected items. The Options argument for popup_select_items/ [3, 4] allows the programmer to place the popup list box in any of the other standard Tk listbox selection modes. For example, the call

? - popup_select_items(

[ ' The first item ', ' Item #2 ',

' Item three ', the_final_item ],

[mode = extended, title = ' Extended Mode Selection ' ],

Selection) .


will popup a list box whose appearance is identical(apart from the different title requested) to the previous listbox. However, it will permit selection of ranges of elements, as seen below

![](images/popup_list_choice-2.gif)

The result of clicking OK will be :

Selection = [Item #2, Item three ]
