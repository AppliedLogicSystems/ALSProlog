`repeat/0` â€” always succeed upon backtracking

## FORMS
```
repeat
```
## DESCRIPTION

`repeat/0` always succeeds, even during backtracking. This behavior is useful for implementing loops which repeatedly perform some side-effect. `repeat/0` is defined by the following clauses:
```
repeat.

repeat :- repeat.
```
## EXAMPLES

The following procedure will repeat forever, reading in an expression and printing out its value.
```
loop 
    :-
    repeat,
    read(Expression),
    Value is Expression,
    write(' Value = '), write(Value), nl,
    fail.
```
