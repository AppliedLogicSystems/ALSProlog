<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">spy/1</code> places a spy point on the procedure name <code class="highlighter-rouge">Name/Arity</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">nospy/1</code> removes a specific spy point, while <code class="highlighter-rouge">nospy/0</code> removes all spy points that are currently set. During consult or reconsult, all spy points are disabled, and spy points on predicates which are consulted or reconsulted are removed. <code class="highlighter-rouge">spy/0</code> re-enables spy points which have been disabled (e.g., those which were not removed, but were disabled during a reconsult).</p>
