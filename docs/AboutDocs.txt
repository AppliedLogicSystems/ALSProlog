About ALSProlog/docs

A very useful item: docs/GNUmakefile consolidates commands for building parts of the docs subsystem.  Execute 'make' in ALSProlog/docs to see the targets available:

SSD > make
Makefile Targets:
all                   Build site and local docs
run                   Run site for live development
site                  Build site in _site
local                 Build local docs in _local_site
test                  Test all markup and links
test-site             Test site
test-local            Test local docs
clean                 Clean all generated files

Generation Of html Files
========================
Broadly, "make all" uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to process the sources (docs/[guide,ref] and the various index.md files, etc., using the _layouts and _includes, etc.) into two versions of the html ALSProlog documentation: the full version in _site and a slightly reduced version in _local_site. The full version in _site appears online at 

	https://alsprolog.com > Documentation [https://alsprolog.com/docs/]

Currently (3/10/19), it also appears at the free testing account

	https://alsprolog.netlify.com  > Documentation [https://alsprolog.com/docs/]

The slightly reduced version in _local_site is packaged with the ALS Prolog releases.

Details About *.md Source Files
===============================
YAML Front-matter occurs at the beginning of a file (*.md), and is delineated by 2 lines of 3 dashes:
---
---

Basic format of docs/guide/*.md
	YAML Front-matter (empty) - just the two lines:
		---
		---
	Includes:
	    toc/no_toc

Basic format of docs/ref/*.md
	YAML Front-matter details
	    Samples:
	    	append3.md:
	    ---
	    title: 'append/3'
	    group: Terms
	    predicates:
	    - {sig: 'append/3', desc: 'append two lists'}
	    - {sig: 'dappend/3', desc: 'append two lists'}
	    ---
	    
	    	listutl1.md:
	    ---
	    title: 'list_diff/3'
	    package: alslib
	    group: Lists
	    module: builtins
	    predicates:
	    - {sig: 'append/2', desc: 'appends a list of lists together'}
	    - {sig: 'int_diff/4', desc: 'returns the intersection and one difference of two lists'}
	    - {sig: 'intersect/2', desc: 'returns the intersection of a list of lists'}
	    ...........
	    ---
	    
	    	clause23.md:
	    ---
	    title: 'clause/[2,3]'
	    group: Prolog Database
	    predicates:
	    - {sig: 'clause', args: {
	        2: 'retrieve a clause',
	        3: 'retrieve a clause with a database reference'
	      }}
	    - {sig: 'instance/2', desc: 'retrieve a clause from the database reference'}
	    ---
	    
	    General Format:
	    ---
	    title: <one of the predicates described on this page>
	    package: <one of ref_packages: from _config.yml; default = Core Prolog>
	    group: Lists <Anything meaningful for the given page>
	    
	    	Although packages are a fixed/declared set (in_config.yml), groups are an open set. 
	    	A group will exist as long as a ref page uses it. For example, if you add a /docs/ref/foo1.md 
	    	file that uses group "Foobars", then "Foobars" will auto-magically appear in the TOC as a group. 
	    
	    module: <default = builtins; nearly all pages should be a single module>
	    predicates:
	    	format for a predicate with a single NAME/ARITY occurrence on the page:
	    - {sig: 'append/2', desc: 'appends a list of lists together'}
	    	format for predicate with multiple NAME/ARITIES occurrences on the page:
	    - {sig: 'clause', args: {
	        2: 'retrieve a clause',
	        3: 'retrieve a clause with a database reference'
	      }}
	    <These formats can occur multiply in any mixed order.>
