ALS Prolog Win32 Foreign SDK Examples
=====================================

The Foreign SDK examples directory contains all the example code described
in the ALS Prolog Foreign Language Interface manual, plus example project
files for building the examples.

Building the Examples
---------------------

All the examples in this directory have project files for both Metrowerk's
CodeWarrior Pro 4 and Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0. It should be possible to build
the examples using other development systems, with little or no modification
to the source code.

To build an example, simply open the project in CodeWarroir or MSVC and select
Make or Build from the Project menu.

Running Examples
----------------

To load .psl (Prolog Shared Library) files you will need to have ALS Prolog
installed.

To run the embeding and static foreign predicate examples, you will need to
have the ALS Prolog DLL and alsdir directory installed in the same directory
as the program or in the system directory.
