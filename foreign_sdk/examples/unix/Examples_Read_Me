=====================================
ALS Prolog Unix Foreign SDK Examples
=====================================

The Foreign SDK examples directory contains all the example code described
in the ALS Prolog Foreign Language Interface manual, plus example make
files for building the examples.

Building the Examples
---------------------

All the examples in this directory use GNU GCC and GNU Make.  It should be
possible to build the examples using other development systems with minor
modifications to the makefiles.

In each example directory there is a generic_makefile and some OS specific
makefiles.

On most systems, the following command will build an example:

% make -f generic_makefile

When there is an OS specific makefile, use it in place of generic_makefile.
For example, on Solaris, use the following command:

% make -f solaris_makefile 

Running Examples
----------------

To load .psl (Prolog Shared Library) files you will need to have ALS Prolog
installed.

To build and run the embeding and static foreign predicate examples, you will
need to have the ALS Prolog shared object/library and the alsdir directory
installed on the system.
