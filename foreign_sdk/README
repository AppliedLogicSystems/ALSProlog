ALS Prolog Foreign SDK Source Tree
==================================

This source tree contains all the files necessary to build the Foreign SDK
distribution.  You should check out this source tree on each platform

Each platform (Unix/Mac/Win32) has a script to build the distribution folder
with the appropriate file naming, etc.

Unix:

Run the shell script "build" in the unix directory to create a distribution
folder.

MacOS:

Run the AppleScipt "Make.script" in the macos folder to create a distribution
folder.

Win32:

Build the project "xxx" in the win32 directory and run the batch script "xxx"
to create a distribution directory.
