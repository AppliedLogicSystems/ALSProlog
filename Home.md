#The ALS Prolog Language: Standard Part

##1 The Syntax of ALS Prolog
This chapter describes the syntax of ALS Prolog, which is for the most part the syntax of the ISO Prolog standard . Prolog syntax is quite simple and regular, which is
a great strength.

###1.1 Constants
The simplest Prolog data type is a constant, which comes in two flavors:
• atoms (sometimes called symbols)
• numbers
The notion of a constant corresponds roughly to the notion of a name in a natural
language. Names in natural languages refer to things (which covers a lot of
ground), and constants in Prolog are be used to refer to things when the language is
interpreted.
